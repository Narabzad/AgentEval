Then, we'll find the largest cube that can fit in that region without going outside the boundaries of $S$. Let's analyze the given constraints of $S$ one by one.\n\n1. The constraint $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\le 25$ is the equation of a solid sphere with radius 5 since, for any point (x, y, z) within this boundary, its Euclidean distance from the origin must be less than or equal to 5.\n\n2. The constraint $z \\ge 0$ restricts the allowed region to be only the \"upper\" half of the sphere. It keeps only those points where the $z$-coordinate is non-negative.\n\nNow that we understand the region $S$ is the upper half of a sphere with radius 5, we can analyze the geometric properties of this region to find the largest cube we can fit inside it.\n\nTo visualize the process, let's imagine we place the cube with one of its vertices at the origin, and the rest of the cube extends in the first octant (positive $x, y, z$ region). We can then scale this cube up or down while keeping it within $S$.\n\nWe can find the largest cube by considering the plane formed by the intersection of $S$ and the surface of the cube that is at the maximum distance from the origin.\n\nLet's consider the three vertices of the cube that lie on this surface. Let these vertices' coordinates be $(a, 0, 0)$, $(0, a, 0)$, and $(0, 0, a)$, where $a$ is the side length of the cube we are trying to find.\n\nSince these vertices lie on the surface of $S$, they must satisfy the two given constraints. The most restrictive of these constraints will be $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\le 25$.\n\nLet's plug in the coordinates of these vertices into the inequality.\n\nFor $(a, 0, 0)$: $a^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 \\le 25$\nFor $(0, a, 0)$: $0^2 + a^2 + 0^2 \\le 25$\nFor $(0, 0, a)$: $0^2 + 0^2 + a^2 \\le 25$\n\nAll three of these conditions give the same inequality $a^2 \\le 25$. Thus, the maximum value of $a$ is $\\sqrt{25} = 5$, and the side length of the largest cube that can fit inside $S$ is $5$.\n\nThis makes sense intuitively since if we were to take a vertical cross-section of this hemisphere and maximize the dimensions of a square contained within a semicircle, the optimal square's side length would be equal to the radius of the semicircle.\n\nSo the side length of the largest cube contained in $S$ is 5.",
