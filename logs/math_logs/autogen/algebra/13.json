  "solution": "We want to have that $f(f(x))=x$ for every $x.$ If $x=0$ then $f(f(0))=f(0)=0,$ so we are fine.\n\nSince $f$ applied to any negative number returns a positive number, and we can get all positive numbers this way, applying $f$ to any positive number must give a negative number. Therefore $k(x)<0$ for any $x>0.$\n\nIf $x>0$ and $f$ is its own inverse then \\[x=f(f(x))=f(k(x))=-\\frac1{2k(x)},\\]where in the last step we used that $k(x)<0.$\n\nSolving this for $k$ gives  \\[k(x)=\\boxed{-\\frac1{2x}}.\\]",
