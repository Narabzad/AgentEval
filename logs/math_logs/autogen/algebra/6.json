  "solution": "If these two graphs intersect then the points of intersection occur when  \\[x^2+a=ax,\\] or  \\[x^2-ax+a=0.\\] This quadratic has solutions exactly when the discriminant is nonnegative: \\[(-a)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot a\\geq0.\\] This simplifies to  \\[a(a-4)\\geq0.\\] This quadratic (in $a$) is nonnegative when $a$ and $a-4$ are either both $\\ge 0$ or both $\\le 0$. This is true for $a$ in $$(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty).$$ Therefore the line and quadratic intersect exactly when $a$ is in $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty)}$.",

Let's first find $x$ in terms of $a$.\n\nStep 1: Rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation in $x$: $x^2 - ax + a = 0$\n\nStep 2: Now, we'll solve this quadratic equation for $x$ using the quadratic formula or factoring.\nSince we can't factor it easily, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $b = -a$, $a = 1$, and $c = a$. Plug in these values to find $x$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the range of $a$ for which we have real solutions for $x$.\nThe solutions for $x$ will be real if the discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$) is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate the range of $a$.\n",
