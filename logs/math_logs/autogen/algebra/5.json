  "problem": "If $\\frac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1}=m$, and $x$ can be any real number except $1$, what real values can $m$ NOT have?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Algebra",
  "solution": "We notice that the numerator of the fraction factors into $(3x-1)(x-1)$. Substituting this into the given expression, we get $m=\\dfrac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1} = \\dfrac{(3x-1)(x-1)}{x-1}$. This simplifies to $m=3x-1$ if $x$ is not 1. Thus, $m$ can be any real number except for the value it takes when $x$ is $1.$ This value is $3(1)-1=3-1=\\boxed{2}$.",

Factor the numerator to easily simplify the function:\n    $(3x^2 - 4x + 1) = (ax + b)(cx + d)$, where $a, b, c, d$ are real numbers.\n2.

Analyze the simplified function for possible values of $m$ that the function does NOT take.\n\nLet's find the factors of the numerator using the code.",
