  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Algebra",
  "solution": "Since $a<b,$ $a-b<0.$ It follows that $|a-b|=-(a-b),$ and the equation can be simplified as  \\[|a-b|+a+b=-(a-b)+a+b=\\boxed{2b}.\\]",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's simplify the given expression step by step:\n\n1. Since $a < b$, the value of $|a-b|$ is equal to $(b-a)$, because the absolute value will remove the negative sign when comparing $a$ and $b$ in this scenario.\n\n2. Now, let's substitute this in the expression:\n\n$|a-b| + a + b = (b-a) + a + b$\n\n3. Simplify the expression:\n\n$(b-a) + a + b = b - a + a + b = b + b = 2b$\n\nSo, the simplified expression for the given problem is $2b$ when $a < b$.",
