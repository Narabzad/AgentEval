Problem 1 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 93

Reply: We know that the sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula:

$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of first $n$ terms, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.

First, let's find the last term, $a_{98}$, of the arithmetic progression using the given information:

$137 = \frac{98}{2}(a_1 + a_{98})$

We will solve for $a_{98}$:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

a1, a98 = symbols("a1 a98")
eq = Eq((98 / 2) * (a1 + a98), 137)
sol = solve(eq, a98)
sol
```

Now, let's find the sum of even indexed terms, i.e., $a_2+a_4+a_6+\dots+a_{98}$.

Since the common difference is $1$, we know that $a_{2n} = a_1 + (2n - 1)$.

We need to find the sum:

$S_{even} = \sum_{n=1}^{49}{a_1+(2n-1)}$

Let's calculate this sum using Python:

```python
def sum_even_terms(a1_value):
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, 50):
        total += a1_value + (2 * n - 1)
    return total

sum_even_terms(a1)
```

Once we have solved for $a_{98}$ and calculated the sum of even indexed terms, we will substitute the values and find the value of $a_2+a_4+a_6+a_8+\dots+a_{98}$.

Problem 3 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: -5

Reply: To find the negative value of k for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations, we'll first solve the system by setting the two equations equal to each other, then finding the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation and setting it to 0 since for exactly one solution, the discriminant should be equal to 0.

Step 1: Set the two equations equal to each other:
2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4

Step 2: Rearrange the equation:
2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0

Step 3: Find the discriminant, D, of the quadratic equation and set it to 0:
D = (k+1)^2 - 4 * 2 * 2 = 0

Now we need to find the negative value of k which satisfies the discriminant equation.

Step 4: Find the value of k:
We will calculate the value using Python.

```python
from sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve

k = Symbol('k')
D = (k+1)**2 - 4*2*2
eq = Eq(D, 0)
k_values = solve(eq, k)
k_values
```

Step 5: Identify the negative value of k.

eq = eq(d, 0)

Problem 8 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: -3

Reply: To find the values of A, B, and C, we need to analyze the given graph. One way to do that is to determine the slope and the y-intercept of the two branches of the curve when it approaches the vertical asymptote. This information should be sufficient to identify the values for A, B, and C.

First, I will get the slope and y-intercept for the left and right branches of the curve:

Step 1 (Coding): Find the slope and y-intercept for both branches by analyzing the points of the graph.
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x, y = symbols('x y')

# As the graph approaches the vertical asymptote from the left, the slope m_left is -1, and y-intercept b_left is 4.
m_left = -1
b_left = 4

# As the graph approaches the vertical asymptote from the right, the slope m_right is 1, and y-intercept b_right is -2.
m_right = 1
b_right = -2

# create a linear equation for both left and right branches
eq_left = Eq(y, m_left * x + b_left)
eq_right = Eq(y, m_right * x + b_right)

# Solve for y in both equations to get y_left and y_right:
y_left = solve(eq_left, y)[0]
y_right = solve(eq_right, y)[0]

print("y_left:", y_left)
print("y_right:", y_right)
```

Step 2 (Language skills): Determine the values of A, B, and C. After executing the code provided in step 1, I will use the slopes and y-intercepts to find A, B, and C.

Problem 9 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 4

Reply: Let's calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:

$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)}$

$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4+12}}{2}$

$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2}$

The square root of 16 is 4, so we have:

$x = \frac{2 \pm 4}{2}$

Now, we can find the two roots a and b:

$a = \frac{2 - 4}{2} = -1$
$b = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3$

Now, let's find the difference b - a:

$b - a = 3 - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4$

So, $b-a$ is 4.

Problem 13 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: -\frac1{2x}

Reply: 1. For $x > 0$, we have $k(k(x)) = x$. Since we can't explicitly solve for $k$ in terms of $x$ with the given information, we'll leave this equation as-is for now.

2. For $x < 0$, we have $k\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = x$. To solve for $k$ in terms of $x$ here, we can substitute $y = -\frac{1}{2x}$, which implies $x = -\frac{1}{2y}$. Substituting this, we get
$$k(y) = -\frac{1}{2y}$$
Since $k(y)$ was derived from the case where $x<0$, this substitution is valid, and we get our desired function for $k(y)$.

3. For $x = 0$, we have $f(0) = 0$. Since this just verifies that the reverse function will map zero back to itself, we don't get any new information about the function $k(x)$.

So, based on our analysis, we find that:

\[k(x) =
\begin{cases}
-\frac{1}{2x}&\text{if }x>0.
\end{cases}
\]

Now let's go back to the original function $f(x)$ and replace $k(x)$ with the function we found:

\[f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-\frac{1}{2x}&\text{if }x>0, \\
-\frac1{2x}&\text{if }x< 0, \\
0&\text{if }x=0.
\end{cases}
\]

So the function $k(x)$ we were looking for is $k(x) = -\frac{1}{2x}$ for $x > 0$. 
Now we can verify that $f(x)$ is indeed its own inverse function by checking that $f(f(x)) = x$ for each case:

Case 1 - $x > 0$: 
$$f(x) = -\frac{1}{2x}$$ 
$$f(f(x)) = f\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = -\frac{1}{2(-\frac{1}{2x})} = x$$

Case 2 - $x < 0$: 
$$f(x) = -\frac{1}{2x}$$ 
$$f(f(x)) = f\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = -\frac{1}{2(-\frac{1}{2x})} = x$$

Case 3 - $x = 0$:
$$f(x) = 0$$
$$f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0 = x$$

The verification confirms that $k(x) = -\frac{1}{2x}$ for $x > 0$ makes $f(x)$ its own inverse function.

So, the value of $f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2$.
