  "problem": "Fake gold bricks are made by covering concrete cubes with gold paint, so the cost of the paint is proportional to their surface area while the cost of the concrete is proportional to their volume.  If a 1 inch cube costs $\\$1.30$ to make while a 2 inch cube costs $\\$6.80$, then how much would a 3 inch cube cost?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Algebra",
  "solution": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.  Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$.  Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$.",

      "content": "First, let's label the cost of the gold paint per square inch as P and the cost of the concrete per cubic inch as C.\n\nWe know that the total cost of a 1-inch cube is $1.30, and it has a surface area of 6 square inches and a volume of 1 cubic inch. Similarly, for a 2-inch cube, the cost is $6.80, and it has a surface area of 24 square inches and a volume of 8 cubic inches.\n\nUsing these two equations, we can solve for P and C:\n\n1. Cost = P * Surface Area + C * Volume\n1.1. $1.30 = P * 6 + C * 1$\n1.2. $6.80 = P * 24 + C * 8$\n\nNow we can write the Python code to solve these equations and find the values for P and C. After that, we will use these values to calculate the cost of a 3-inch cube, which has a surface area of 54 square inches and a volume of 27 cubic inches.",
