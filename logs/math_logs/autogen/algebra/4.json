  "solution": "For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.",

      "content": "To find all positive integer values of c for which the equation x^2 - 7x + c = 0 has real and rational roots, we need to use the discriminant formula of a quadratic equation. If the discriminant is greater than or equal to 0, then the quadratic equation will have real roots. If it is a perfect square, the roots will be rational.\n\nThe discriminant D is given by the formula:\n\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. In our case, a = 1, b = -7, and we need to find the valid values of c.\n\nSo, we need to calculate the discriminant and test whether it's a perfect square.\n\n1. Calculate the discriminant D for each positive integer value of c.\n2. If D is a perfect square and greater than or equal to 0, add the valid c to our list of potential c values.\n3. Print the list of valid c values in decreasing order, separated by commas.\n\nLet's execute this code in Python.",
