We know that the largest value of x for which the two functions intersect cannot be too large, because the difference in coefficients of x^3 and x^2 terms are significant. To search for that, I will iterate through values of x from 1 to 50 in increments of 1, and calculate the value of f-x and g-x at each step. Whenever the sign of the difference changes from positive to negative or vice versa, we know there was an intersection point in that range. Then we can use a smaller increment to narrow down the range even further.\n",
