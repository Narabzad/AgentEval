  "solution": "For an integer $abcde$ to be divisible by $11$ then $a-b+c-d+e$ is divisible by $11.$\n\nWe start with the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 0.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d.$ Since we have a palindrome, we must have $a = e$ and $b = d,$ meaning that $2a+c=2b.$ We must have that $a$ and $e$ must be at least $1,$ so then we can let $b$ and $d$ also be 1 and $c$ be zero. So the smallest such five-digit palindrome is $11011.$\n\nThen, we investigate the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 11.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d+11,$ and $a = e$ and $b = d,$ so  $2a + c = 11 + 2b.$ We see that we can let $a$ be 1 and $c$ be 9, then $b = 0,$ and we have the palindrome $10901.$\n\nFinally, $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = -11.$ Then, $2a + c = 2b - 11.$ We check if $a = 1$ has any solutions. We get $2 + c = 2b - 11,$ so $c - 2b = -9.$ Then, we can see that there are no solutions for $b = 0$, since then we would have $c = -9.$ Since we already found $10901,$ we do not need to check for any $b$ greater than $0$, so we see that our solution is $\\boxed{10901}.$",
