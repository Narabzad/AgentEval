  "solution": "Let $k = n+2005$. Since $1 \\le n \\le 9999$, we have $2006 \\le k \\le 12004$. We know that $k$ has exactly 21 positive factors. The number of positive factors of a positive integer with prime factorization $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_r^{e_r}$ is $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots(e_r+1)$. Since $21 = 7 \\cdot 3$ and 7 and 3 are prime, the prime factorization of $k$ is either of the form $p^{20}$ or $p^6 q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers. Since $p^{20} \\geq 2^{20} > 12004$ for any prime $p$, we can't have the first form. So $k = p^6 q^2$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q$.\n\nIf $p=2$, then $k=64q^2$. So $2006 \\le 64q^2 \\le 12004 \\Rightarrow 31.34375 \\le q^2 \\le 187.5625$. For $q$ an integer, this holds when $6 \\le q \\le 13$. Since $q$ is prime, $q$ is 7, 11, or 13. So if $p=2$, the possible values of $k$ are $2^6 7^2 = 3136$, $2^6 11^2 = 7744$, and $2^6 13^2 = 10816$.\n\nIf $p=3$, then $k = 729q^2$. So $2006 \\le 729q^2 \\le 12004 \\Rightarrow 2.75\\ldots \\le q^2 \\le 16.46\\ldots$. For $q$ an integer, this holds when $2 \\le q \\le 4$. Since $q$ is a prime distinct from $p=3$, we have $q=2$. So if $p=3$, $k = 3^6 2^2 = 2916$.\n\nIf $p \\ge 5$, then $k \\ge 15625q^2 > 12004$, a contradiction. So we have found all possible values of $k$. The sum of the possible values of $n = k - 2005$ is thus \\begin{align*}\n&(3136-2005) \\\\\n+ &(7744-2005)\\\\\n+ &(10816-2005)\\\\\n+ &(2916-2005)\\\\\n= &\\boxed{16592}.\n\\end{align*}",

If a number $x$ has a prime factorization of $p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$, then the total number of factors of $x$ (including 1 and $x$) is given by $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)...(a_k+1)$.\n\nWe know $n+2005$ has 21 factors. Since 21 = 3 \u00d7 7, we can write it in two ways: $(a_1+1)(a_2+1) = (2+1)(6+1) = 3 \u00d7 7$ or $(a_1+1)(a_2+1) = (6+1)(2+1) = 7 \u00d7 3$.\n\nNext, let's find all possible values of n by iterating through all combinations of factors and prime factorizations of $(n+2005)$ that satisfy the conditions.
