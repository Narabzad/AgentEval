  "solution": "Use the Euclidean algorithm on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. \\begin{align*}\nh(x) &= \\gcd(f(x), g(x)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(12x+7, 5x+2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5x+2, (12x+7)-2(5x+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5x+2, 2x + 3) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2x+3, (5x+2)-2(2x+3)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2x+3, x - 4) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(x-4, (2x+3)-2(x-4)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(x-4, 11)\n\\end{align*}From applying the Euclidean algorithm, we have that the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is 11 if and only if $x-4$ is a multiple of 11. For example, note that $f(4) = 55$ and $g(4) = 22$, and the greatest common divisor of 55 and 22 turns out to be 11. If $x-4$ is not a multiple of 11, then the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be one, since 11 is prime and therefore has no other factors. It follows that $h(x)$ can take on two distinct values; 1 and 11. The sum of all possible values of $h(x)$ is therefore $1 + 11 = \\boxed{12}$.",
