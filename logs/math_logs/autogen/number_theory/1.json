  "problem": "A Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$.",

Calculate the number of minutes passed in the last incomplete hour.\n3. Calculate the population increase during the last incomplete hour.\n4. Subtract the population increase from the final population (137) to find the initial population.\n\nLet's follow these steps using python code.",
