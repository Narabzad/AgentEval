  "problem": "There are two cameras that take pictures of a traffic intersection. Camera A starts taking pictures at $6$ AM and takes a picture every $11$ minutes. Camera B starts taking pictures at $7$ AM and takes pictures every $7$ minutes. Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time at four different times before noon. When Camera A and Camera B take their last picture together, how many minutes before noon is it?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "If Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time, they will take a picture $77$ minutes later at the same time. Therefore, if we can find the first time they take a picture together, then we can continue adding $77$ minutes to figure out when the fourth picture was taken. Camera A's first pictures after $7$ AM is at $7:06$, followed by $7:17$ and $7:28$. Camera B will take a picture at $7:28$. From here, we add $77$ minutes until we have taken four pictures. $7:28$ is followed by $8:45$, which is followed by $10:02$, which is followed by $11:19$. This is $\\boxed{41}$ minutes before noon.",

We will list the timestamps of the pictures taken by each camera and determine when they overlap.\n\nFirstly, let's calculate the time schedule for each camera separately.\n\nStep 1 - Calculate the time schedule of Camera A (time in minutes after 6:00 AM).\nStep 2 - Calculate the time schedule of Camera B (time in minutes after 7:00 AM).\nStep 3 - Find the common times between Camera A and Camera B before noon (720 minutes after 6:00 AM).\n\nOnce we have the overlapping times, we will determine the last instance when both cameras took a picture together and find out how many minutes before noon it is.\n\nLet's start with Step 1 and Step 2 calculations.",
