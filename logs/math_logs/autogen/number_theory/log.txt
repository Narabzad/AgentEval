Problem 0 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 226

Reply: To find the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144, we need to first find all these factors. We can do this by iterating through the numbers from 10 to 99 and checking if they are factors of 144. Then, we can sum these factors and print their sum.

Here's a Python script to accomplish this:

```python
two_digit_factors = []

for i in range(10, 100):
    if 144 % i == 0:
        two_digit_factors.append(i)

sum_of_factors = sum(two_digit_factors)
print("The sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144 is:", sum_of_factors)
```

Please run this script to find the desired sum.

Problem 11 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 12

Reply: To find the sum of all possible values of h(x), we can use the following plan:

1. Find the general expression for h(x) using their greatest common divisor (GCD) based on f(x) and g(x).
2. Find the maximum value of x such that h(x) > 1.
3. Calculate h(x) for all positive integer values of x and find their sum.

Step 1: Find the general expression for h(x) based on f(x) and g(x).
Let's write the python code to find the expression for h(x) using the gcd() function from the math library.

```python
from math import gcd

def f(x):
    return 12*x + 7

def g(x):
    return 5*x + 2

def h(x):
    return gcd(f(x), g(x))

print(h(x))
```

Now that we have the expression for h(x), let's move on to step 2. 

Step 2: Find the maximum value of x such that h(x) > 1.
To find the maximum value of x for when h(x) > 1, we can execute the python code below.

```python
x = 1
while h(x) > 1:
    x += 1

max_value_of_x = x - 1
print("The maximum value of x is:", max_value_of_x)
```

Step 3: Calculate h(x) for all positive integer values of x and find their sum.
Once we find the maximum value of x, we can calculate h(x) for all values of x and find their sum using the python code below.

```python
sum_of_hx_values = sum(h(x) for x in range(1, max_value_of_x + 1))
print("The sum of all possible values of h(x) is:", sum_of_hx_values)

Problem 15 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac19

Reply: To find the probability, we need to first find the total number of four-digit palindromes and then find the number of those palindromes that are multiples of 99. Finally, we will divide the number of multiples of 99 by the total number of four-digit palindromes.

Step 1: Find the number of four-digit palindromes.
A four-digit palindrome is in the form "ABBA." There are 9 options for A (1-9), and 10 options for B (0-9). So, there are 9 * 10 = 90 possible four-digit palindromes.

Step 2: Find the number of palindromes that are multiples of 99.
We can use a Python script to calculate this:

```python
four_digit_palindromes = [int(str(a) + str(b) + str(b) + str(a)) for a in range(1, 10) for b in range(10)]
palindromes_multiple_of_99 = [x for x in four_digit_palindromes if x % 99 == 0]
count_multiples_of_99 = len(palindromes_multiple_of_99)
```

Step 3: Calculate the probability.
Let's divide the number of multiples of 99 by the total number of four-digit palindromes and simplify the fraction.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
probability = Fraction(count_multiples_of_99, len(four_digit_palindromes)).simplify()  # Note that len(four_digit_palindromes) = 90
