  "solution": "There are \\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{6!\\cdot 2!} = 28\n\\]ways to choose the bills. A sum of at least $\\$20$ is obtained by choosing  both $\\$20$ bills, one of the  $\\$20$ bills and one of the six smaller bills, or both $\\$10$ bills.   Hence the probability is \\[\n\\frac{ 1 + 2\\cdot 6 + 1}{28}=\\frac{14}{28}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]",

Finally, we will divide the number of successful combinations by the total number of combinations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of ways to draw 2 bills out of 8 (combination).\n2. Calculate the number of successful combinations (with a sum of $20 or more).\n3. Divide the number of successful combinations by the total number of combinations to find the probability.\n\nLet's execute these steps using Python code.",
