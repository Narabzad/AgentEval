  "solution": "Each card has an equal likelihood of being either on top of the jokers, in between them, or below the jokers.  Thus, on average, $1/3$ of them will land between the two jokers. Multiplying this by the 52 yields our answer of $\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}$.",

      "content": "To find the expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers, we can use the concept of probability.\n\nLet's denote Joker A and Joker B. There are a total of 54 cards in the deck (52 regular cards plus the two jokers). The probability of drawing Joker A at a specific position is 1/54. After Joker A has been chosen, there are 53 cards left, and the probability of drawing Joker B at a specific position is 1/53.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of cards in between Joker A and Joker B. For example, if Joker A is in position 1 and Joker B is in position x+2, then there are x cards between them. We will calculate the probability of having x cards between the Jokers and sum up these probabilities multiplied by x.\n\nThe probability of having x cards between Joker A and Joker B is the probability of Joker A being at position i and Joker B being at position i+x+2, or vice versa.\nNow summing up probabilities multiplied by x:\n\nExpected number of cards between the two jokers = \u03a3[(x * P(Joker A at position i and Joker B at position i+x+2)) + (x * P(Joker B at position i and Joker A at position i+x+2))]\n\nWe will compute this sum from x = 0 to x = 51 using Python code.",
