  "problem": "Maria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. How many ways are there for her to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges?  (Note: Maria takes none of the fruit herself, and some of her friends might not receive any fruit at all.)",

  "solution": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",

Distributing apples:\n\nMaria has 3 identical apples to distribute among 4 friends. This can be thought of as distributing 3 apples into 4 bins, with each bin representing a friend. We need to know how many ways to split 3 apples into 4 bins (order matters).\n\nSo, we'll use the stars and bars method where the number of bins (friends) will be represented as \u2588 and the items (apples) will be represented as *.\n\nExample: **\u2588*\u2588*\u2588\n\nThis example represents the configuration with all 3 apples going to one friend and the other 3 friends getting no apples. \n\nLet's calculate the number of ways to distribute the apples by writing Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# calculating number of ways to distribute apples\napples = 3\nfriends = 4\nways_apples = comb(apples + friends - 1, apples)\nprint(ways_apples)\n```\n\n2. Distributing oranges:\n\nSince Jacky doesn't get any oranges, we have 3 identical oranges to distribute among 3 friends. Similar to apples, we'll use the stars and bars method.\n\nLet's calculate the number of ways to distribute the oranges by writing Python code:\n\n```python\n# calculating number of ways to distribute oranges without Jacky\noranges = 3\nways_oranges = comb(oranges + friends - 1 - 1, oranges)\nprint(ways_oranges)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the Python code in a single block to efficiently find these combinatory results:\n\n",
