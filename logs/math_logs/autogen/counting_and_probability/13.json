Arrangements can be reflected or not reflected and can be rotated by 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, or 300 degrees, so they come in groups of twelve equivalent arrangements. Correcting for the symmetries, we find that there are $7!/12=\\boxed{420}$ distinct arrangements.",

      "content": "We can solve this problem using Burnside's lemma. Burnside's lemma relates the number of orbits of a set under a group action to the sum of the number of elements left fixed by each group element. Let's first identify the symmetry group of the hexagonal grid and calculate the number of fixed elements for each symmetry operation.\n\nFor the hexagonal grid, the symmetry group has 12 operations: 6 rotations (0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, and 300\u00b0) and 6 reflections about the six axes of symmetry.\n\nNow, we will find the number of fixed elements for each rotation and reflection:\n\n1. Rotation by 0\u00b0 (identity): All 7! (7 factorial) grid arrangements are fixed.\n2. Rotation by 60\u00b0, 300\u00b0, 120\u00b0, and 240\u00b0: There are one 3-bead cycle and one 2-bead cycle in each of these rotations, so for each rotation, there are 3! * 2! fixed grid arrangements.\n3. Rotation by 180\u00b0: Two 3-bead cycles exist in this rotation, so there are 3! * 3! fixed grid arrangements.\n4. Reflection about any of the six axes: There is one 4-bead cycle and one 2-bead cycle in each reflection, so for each reflection, there are 4! * 2! fixed grid arrangements.\n\nNow, let's use Burnside's lemma to find out the number of distinct bead arrangements:\n\n Plan:\n 1. Calculate the factorial of given numbers.\n 2. Use Burnside's lemma formula: ( Sum of fixed grid arrangements ) / ( Total number of group elements )\n 3. Print the result\n\nNow let's write a code to calculate the number of distinct bead arrangements using Burnside's lemma.",
