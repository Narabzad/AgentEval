  "solution": "Consider the four random points before they are labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. In the general case, they will be distinct, forming a convex quadrilateral. Suppose $A$ is labeled. If $B$ is labeled as the vertex opposite $A$, segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect; otherwise, they will not. Since there are 3 points to label as $B$, the probability these segments intersect is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.

  "response_with_ans": "We can solve this problem step by step using a geometric approach and a bit of combinatorics. \n\n1. First, we always assume that point $A$ is fixed at an arbitrary position on the circumference of the circle. This is because, relative positions of the points matter for AB and CD to intersect.\n2. Next, we place point $B$ somewhere on the circumference (it can be anywhere). Once point $B$ is placed, it divides the circle into two parts, the major and the minor arc formed between points $A$ and $B$. \n3. In order for segments $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, point $C$ must fall in one of the two parts, say the minor arc formed by $A$ and $B$ (If it falls in the major arc, just swap points A and B). \n4. Since the relative position of $C$ is what really matters for the intersection of $AB$ and $CD$, consider distributions of point $D$ to make $AB$ and $CD$ intersect. If $C$ falls in the minor arc formed by $A$ and $B$, then $D$ can be anywhere in the major arc formed by the same points.\n\nThe probability of the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersecting can now be calculated easily based on our observations, given that the positions of $B$, $C$, and $D$ are uniformly distributed along the circumference of the circle.\n\nLet p1 be the probability of $C$ falling in the minor arc of $A$ and $B$.\nLet p2 be the probability of $D$ falling in the major arc of $A$ and $B$ (given that $C$ is already in the minor arc).\n\nThe probability of intersection is the product of p1 and p2.\n\nSince we can rotate and choose any two points as $A$ and $B$, the probability of $C$ falling in one of the two arcs is 1. Therefore, p1 = 1.\n\nTo calculate p2, we can simply find the ratio of the major arc and the entire circle. This can be given as p2 = (1 - (angle_A)/360), where angle_A is the angle (/arc) formed by A and B at the center of the circle.\n\nLet's calculate the average angle between two points on a circle. Since the_points are placed independently and uniformly on the circumference, the expected position of B is exactly opposite to A. Hence, the average angle between A and B is 180 degrees.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability p2 as (1 - (180/360)) = 1/2.\n\nNow the overall probability of intersection of segments $AB$ and $CD$ is the product of p1 and p2, which is 1 * 1/2 = 1/2, or 0.5.\n\nSo, the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is 0.5 or 50%.\n\nTERMINATE",
