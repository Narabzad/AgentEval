  "solution": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a \"complementary\" counting method. First, we'll find the number of possible seating arrangements without any restrictions, which is given by $(n-1)!$ for n people in a circular arrangement. Then, we'll subtract the number of seating arrangements where at least 2 of the 3 forbidden pairs (Pierre-Rosa, Pierre-Thomas, and Rosa-Thomas) are seated next to each other. Finally, we'll add back the seating arrangements where all three are seated next to each other since they were subtracted twice.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the total number of seating arrangements without restrictions for the 7 people, which is $(7-1)!$.\n2. Compute the number of seating arrangements where Pierre and Rosa are seated next to each other, treating them as a single entity (we now have 6 \"entities\"). This is $(6-1)!$. The same goes for Pierre-Thomas and Rosa-Thomas pairs.\n3. Subtract the number of seating arrangements where all three are seated next to each other. Treating all three as a single entity, we now have 5 \"entities\". This is $(5-1)!$.\n\nNow, let's calculate these scenarios:\n\n1. Total seating arrangements without restrictions\n2. Seating arrangements with Pierre-Rosa\n3. Seating arrangements with Pierre-Thomas\n4. Seating arrangements with Rosa-Thomas\n5. Seating arrangements where all three are seated next to each other\n\nFinally, we will compute the number of seating arrangements by subtracting the cases we mentioned and adding the case where all three are seated next to each other.",
