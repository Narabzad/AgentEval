  "solution": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.  So the answer is \\[1-2\\frac{\\binom{26}{3}}{\\binom{52}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}.\\]",

We will first find the probability that all three cards are the same color and subtract it from 1.\n\nThere are two colors in a standard deck of cards: red and black. There are 26 red cards and 26 black cards in the deck.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the probability of drawing three red cards in a row:\n\n   (number of ways to choose 3 red cards) / (total ways to choose 3 cards from the 52-card deck)\n   \n2. Next, calculate the probability of drawing three black cards in a row:\n\n   (number of ways to choose 3 black cards) / (total ways to choose 3 cards from the 52-card deck)\n   \n3. Add both probabilities.\n\n4. Subtract the result from 1.\n\nWe can implement this calculation using Python.",
