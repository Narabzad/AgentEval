  "solution": "Let's count as our outcomes the ways to select 3 people without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways to select any 3 people.  The number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to select 3 consecutive people.  There are only 10 ways to do this -- think of first selecting the middle person, then we take his or her two neighbors.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{120} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$.",
