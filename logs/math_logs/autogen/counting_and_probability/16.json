  "solution": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$.",

      "content": "We can use the concept of combinations to find the probability. The total number of ways to choose 6 peppers from the 15 available peppers is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In our case, n = 15 (total peppers) and k = 6 (peppers to select).\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways that the cook can choose at least 4 green peppers. This can happen in one of the two ways:\n\n1. Choose 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers\n2. Choose 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper\n\nFor the first scenario, we can find the combinations of selecting 4 green peppers from 5 available green peppers and 2 red peppers from 10 available red peppers. Similarly, for the second scenario, we can find the combinations of selecting 5 green peppers from 5 available green peppers and 1 red pepper from 10 available red peppers.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the sum of the combinations from both scenarios by the total combinations of selecting 6 peppers. \n\nI will now calculate the probability using code.",
