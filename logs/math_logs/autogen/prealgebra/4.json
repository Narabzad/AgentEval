  "solution": "We can treat this list as a sequence with a repetitive pattern. We see the sequence repeats itself every 24 elements (from 1 to 13 then back to 2). When 5000 is divided by 24, its remainder is 8. Therefore we see the $5000^{\\text{th}}$ integer is the same as the $8^{\\text{th}}$ integer, which is $\\boxed{8}$.",

Each group is either counting up from 1 to 13 or counting down from 13 to 1. There are 13 numbers in each direction, but since 1 is counted twice (once at the end of a down-count and once at the beginning of an up-count), counting up and down would consist of 25 numbers (13 up + 12 down).\n\nLet's first find out which group the 5000th number belongs to and how many numbers in total are in the complete up and down groups before 5000th number using code:\n\n```python\nnum_group = 5000 // 25\nremainder = 5000 % 25\ntotal_numbers_before = num_group * 25\nprint('Number of complete groups:', num_group)\nprint('Remainder:', remainder)\nprint('Numbers before 5000th number:', total_numbers_before)\n```\n\nAfter knowing these values, I'll determine if the 5000th number is in up-count or down-count and its value.\n",
