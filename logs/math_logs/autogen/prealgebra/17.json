  "problem": "What is the sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of the two legs of a 30-60-90 right triangle, if the length of the hypotenuse is $2\\sqrt{6}$ centimeters?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "We know that the ratio of the lengths of the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. We know that the length of the hypotenuse is $2\\sqrt{6}$ and the ratio of the length shortest leg to that of the hypotenuse is $1:2$. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\\sqrt{6}$. Since the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $1:\\sqrt{3}$, the length of the longer leg is $\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. The sum of the lengths of these two legs is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters.",

Opposite the 30-degree angle: $x$\n2. Opposite the 60-degree angle: $x\\sqrt{3}$\n3. Hypotenuse (opposite the 90-degree angle): $2x$\n\nNow, we are given that the hypotenuse is $2\\sqrt{6}$ centimeters. We can set up the following equation and solve for $x$:\n\n$2x = 2\\sqrt{6}$\n\nNext, we will find the lengths of the legs and sum them up.",
