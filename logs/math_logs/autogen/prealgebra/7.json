Let D be the vertex of the right triangle that is not a part of the equilateral triangle (the $60^\\circ$ angle).\n\nSince the shorter leg of the right triangle is 6 units (AD) and it is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, we know that:\n1. The longer leg (BD) has a length equal to the shorter leg times $\\sqrt{3}$ ($6\\sqrt{3}$ units).\n2. The hypotenuse (AB) has a length twice the size of the shorter leg (12 units).\n\nNow, we are trying to find the distance between vertices C and D. Let's call this distance x.\n\nTo calculate x, we can use the law of cosines on triangle $\\bigtriangleup BCD$. Here, the angle at vertex B is $180^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ$. We have the lengths of sides BC and BD, so we can calculate x using the law of cosines and then simplify the result.\n\nThe law of cosines formula is:\nx^2 = (BC^2) + (BD^2) - 2(BC)(BD)cos(120^\\circ)",
