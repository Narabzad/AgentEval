  "solution": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{05}$ to a fraction. Let's define $x=0.\\overline{05}$. If we multiply both sides by $100$ we get $100x=5.\\overline{05}$ so $99x=5$ and $x=0.\\overline{05}=\\frac{5}{99}$. Since $1.8=\\frac{9}{5}$ we get  $$\\frac{\\cancel{5}}{99}\\cdot\\frac{9}{\\cancel{5}}=\\frac{9}{99}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}.$$",

      "content": "To find the product of $0.\\overline{05}$ and $1.8$, first we need to convert the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{05}$ into a fraction.\n\nLet's call the repeating decimal $x$:\n\n$$x = 0.\\overline{05}$$\n\nTo convert the repeating decimal into a fraction, we can multiply both sides by $100$ to shift the decimal point two places to the right:\n\n$$100x = 5.\\overline{05}$$\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n$$100x - x = 5.\\overline{05} - 0.\\overline{05}$$\n$$99x = 5$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{5}{99}$$\n\nSo the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{05}$ is equivalent to the fraction $\\frac{5}{99}$.\n\nNow, we can find the product of $\\frac{5}{99}$ and $1.8$:\n\n$$\\frac{5}{99} \\times 1.8$$\n\nFinally, we will simplify the fraction. Let's write the code to compute the product and simplify the result as a fraction.",
