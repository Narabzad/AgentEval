Problem 0 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: -89

Reply: We know that $x + y = 180^\circ$. From this equation, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = 180^\circ - x$.

Now we substitute the expression for $y$ in the expression of angle $ACB$:
$ACB = 90^\circ - y = 90^\circ - (180^\circ - x) = x - 90^\circ$.

Comparing this expression with the given form $(Mx + N)^\circ$, we can see that $M = 1$ and $N = -90$. Therefore, $M + N = 1 + (-90) = -89$.

The value of $M + N$ is $-89$.

Problem 3 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 351

Reply: To calculate the total number of cake-eating days, we will first calculate the number of days between Amaretta's birthday and Enzo's birthday in a non-leap year and in a leap year. Then, we will count the number of leap years and non-leap years in the given range (2008-2016). Finally, we will sum the total number of days for each type of year for both non-leap and leap years.

Please run the following Python code:

```python
from datetime import date

amaretta_birthday = date(2008, 7, 27)
enzo_birthday = date(2008, 9, 3)

normal_year_days = (enzo_birthday - amaretta_birthday).days + 1
leap_year_days = normal_year_days + 1

leap_years = [year for year in range(2008, 2017) if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)]

Problem 4 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 8

Reply: We can solve this problem by finding which "group" the 5000th number belongs to, and then determine the number within that group. Each group is either counting up from 1 to 13 or counting down from 13 to 1. There are 13 numbers in each direction, but since 1 is counted twice (once at the end of a down-count and once at the beginning of an up-count), counting up and down would consist of 25 numbers (13 up + 12 down).

Let's first find out which group the 5000th number belongs to and how many numbers in total are in the complete up and down groups before 5000th number using code:

```python
num_group = 5000 // 25
remainder = 5000 % 25
total_numbers_before = num_group * 25
print('Number of complete groups:', num_group)
print('Remainder:', remainder)
print('Numbers before 5000th number:', total_numbers_before)
```

After knowing these values, I'll determine if the 5000th number is in up-count or down-count and its value.
