  "solution": "Let $P(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e.$  Then $P(x^2) = ax^8 + bx^6 + cx^4 + dx^2 + e$ and\n\\begin{align*}\nP(x) P(-x) &= (ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e)(ax^4 - bx^3 + cx^2 - dx + e) \\\\\n&= (ax^4 + cx^2 + e)^2 - (bx^3 + dx)^2 \\\\\n&= (a^2 x^8 + 2acx^6 + (2ae + c^2) x^4 + 2cex^2 + e^2) - (b^2 x^6 + 2bdx^4 + d^2 x^2) \\\\\n&= a^2 x^8 + (2ac - b^2) x^6 + (2ae - 2bd + c^2) x^4 + (2ce - d^2) x^2 + e^2.\n\\end{align*}Comparing coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 &= a, \\\\\n2ac - b^2 &= b, \\\\\n2ae - 2bd + c^2 &= c, \\\\\n2ce - d^2 &= d, \\\\\ne^2 &= e.\n\\end{align*}From $a^2 = a,$ $a = 0$ or $a = 1.$  But $P(x)$ has degree 4, which means that the coefficient of $x^4$ cannot be 0, so $a = 1.$\n\nFrom $e^2 = e,$ $e = 0$ or $e = 1.$\n\nCase 1: $e = 0.$\n\nThe equations become\n\\begin{align*}\n2c - b^2 &= b, \\\\\n-2bd + c^2 &= c, \\\\\n-d^2 &= d.\n\\end{align*}From $-d^2 = d,$ $d = 0$ or $d = -1.$  If $d = 0,$ then $c^2 = c,$ so $c = 0$ or $c = 1.$\n\nIf $c = 0,$ then $-b^2 = b,$ so $b = 0$ or $b = -1.$  If $c = 1,$ then $2 - b^2 = b,$ so $b^2 + b - 2 = (b - 1)(b + 2) = 0,$ which means $b = 1$ or $b = -2.$\n\nIf $d = -1,$ then\n\\begin{align*}\n2c - b^2 &= b, \\\\\n2b + c^2 &= c.\n\\end{align*}Adding these equations, we get $2b + 2c - b^2 + c^2 = b + c,$ so\n\\[b + c - b^2 + c^2 = (b + c) + (b + c)(-b + c) = (b + c)(1 - b + c) = 0.\\]Hence, $b + c = 0$ or $1 - b + c = 0.$\n\nIf $b + c = 0,$ then $c = -b.$  Substituting into $2c - b^2 = b,$ we get $-2b - b^2 = b,$ so $b^2 + 3b = b(b + 3) = 0.$  Hence, $b = 0$ (and $c = 0$) or $b = -3$ (and $c = 3$).\n\nIf $1 - b + c = 0,$ then $c = b - 1.$  Substituting into $2c - b^2 = b,$ we get $2b - 2 - b^2 = b,$ so $b^2 - b + 2 = 0.$  This quadratic has no real roots.\n\nCase 2: $e = 1.$\n\nThe equations become\n\\begin{align*}\n2c - b^2 &= b, \\\\\n2 - 2bd + c^2 &= c, \\\\\n2c - d^2 &= d.\n\\end{align*}We have that $2c = b^2 + b = d^2 + d,$ so\n\\[b^2 - d^2 + b - d = (b - d)(b + d) + (b - d) = (b - d)(b + d + 1) = 0.\\]Hence, $b = d$ or $b + d + 1 = 0.$\n\nIf $b + d + 1 = 0,$ then $d = -b - 1.$  Substituting into $2 - 2bd + c^2 = c,$ we get\n\\[2 - 2b(-b - 1) + c^2 = c,\\]so $2b^2 + 2b + c^2 - c + 2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $b$ and $c,$ we get\n\\[2 \\left( b + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( c - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{5}{4} = 0,\\]so there are no real solutions where $b + d + 1 = 0.$\n\nIf $b = d,$ then the equations become\n\\begin{align*}\n2c - b^2 &= b, \\\\\n2 - 2b^2 + c^2 &= c.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $c = \\frac{b^2 + b}{2}.$  Substituting into the second equation, we get\n\\[2 - 2b^2 + \\left( \\frac{b^2 + b}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2 + b}{2}.\\]This simplifies to $b^4 + 2b^3 - 9b^2 - 2b + 8 = 0,$ which factors as $(b + 4)(b + 1)(b - 1)(b - 2) = 0.$  Hence, the possible values of $b$ are $-4$, $-1,$ 1, and 2, with corresponding values of $c$ of 6, 0, 1, and 3, respectively.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ polynomials $P(x),$ namely\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 &= x^4, \\\\\nx^4 - x^3 &= x^3(x - 1), \\\\\nx^4 + x^3 + x^2 &= x^2 (x^2 + x + 1), \\\\\nx^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 &= x^2 (x - 1)^2, \\\\\nx^4 - x &= x(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1), \\\\\nx^4 - 3x^3 + 3x^2 - x &= x(x - 1)^3, \\\\\nx^4 - 4x^2 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 &= (x - 1)^4, \\\\\nx^4 - x^3 - x + 1 &= (x - 1)^2 (x^2 + x + 1), \\\\\nx^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 &= x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, \\\\\nx^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1 &= (x^2 + x + 1)^2.\n\\end{align*}",
