  "solution": "For a triangle with side lengths $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ let $s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2},$ and let\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= s - a = \\frac{-a + b + c}{2}, \\\\\ny &= s - b = \\frac{a - b + c}{2}, \\\\\nz &= s - c = \\frac{a + b - c}{2}.\n\\end{align*}By the Triangle Inequality, $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all positive.  (This technique is often referred to as the Ravi Substitution.)  Note that\n\\begin{align*}\na &= y + z, \\\\\nb &= x + z, \\\\\nc &= x + y.\n\\end{align*}If $s$ is even, then $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all positive integers.  So, we can set $x = i,$ $y = j,$ and $z = k,$ which gives us the parameterization $(a,b,c) = (j + k, i + k, i + j).$\n\nIf $s$ is odd, then $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all of the form $n - \\frac{1}{2},$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  So, we can set $x = i - \\frac{1}{2},$ $y = j - \\frac{1}{2},$ and $z = k - \\frac{1}{2}.$  This gives us the parameterization $(a,b,c) = (j + k - 1, i + k - 1, i + j - 1).$\n\nThus, our sum is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{(a,b,c) \\in T} \\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} &= \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} + \\frac{2^{j + k - 1}}{3^{i + k - 1} 5^{i + j - 1}} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} + \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{17}{2} \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{17}{2} \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{15^i} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^j \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^k \\\\\n&= \\frac{17}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1/15}{1 - 1/15} \\cdot \\frac{2/5}{1 - 2/5} \\cdot \\frac{2/3}{1 - 2/3} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{17}{21}}.\n\\end{align*}",

      "content": "We'll solve this problem step by step. First, we need to identify the conditions for a valid triangle $(a, b, c)$. A triangle is valid if it satisfies the triangle inequality: $a + b > c$, $a + c > b$, and $b + c > a$. Next, we'll iterate over all possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ within reasonable bounds and apply the triangle inequality to check if they form a valid triangle. If so, we'll compute $\\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}$ for that triple and sum the results.\n\nSince the terms $\\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}$ converge very fast, we can determine a reasonable bound for $a$, $b$, and $c$. We could set an upper bound for the sum of the fractions, let's say $0.001$. As $2^a < 3^b 5^c$, we can expect that the largest $a$ would be less than the smallest $b$ and $c$. For the upper bound on $a$, we check $2^{21} = 2097152 \\approx 3^7 5^3 = 1913625$. So, we can set the bound for $a$ to be $21$.\n\nFor the upper bound on $b$ and $c$, we can consider that the fraction must be less than ($0.001$). Therefore, we can say $\\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}<0.001$ and we have already bounded $a$ to $21$. This means $\\frac{2^{21}}{3^b 5^c}<0.001$, and after calculating $b$ and $c$ we get $9$ and $5$ respectively.\n\nNow, we'll iterate through all values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and check if they form a valid triangle, then compute the sum of the fractions.",
