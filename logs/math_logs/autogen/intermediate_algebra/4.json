Since $ab = 8$, we have $b = \\frac{8}{a}$. Now let's plug this in for $b$ to get an expression in terms of $a$:\n\n$$\\frac{a^2 + (\\frac{8}{a})^2}{a - \\frac{8}{a}}$$\n\nNow we have the expression in terms of $a$. We can find the derivative of this expression with respect to $a$, set it to zero, and solve for the critical points. Then we can check those points for minimization.",
