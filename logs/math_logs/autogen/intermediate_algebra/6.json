  "solution": "Since $x + y = 2,$ there exists a real number $t$ such that $x = 1 + t$ and $y = 1 - t.$  Then\n\\[(1 + t)^5 + (1 - t)^5 = 82.\\]This simplifies to $10t^4 + 20t^2 - 80 = 0.$  This equation factors as $10(t^2 - 2)(t^2 + 4) = 0,$ so $t = \\pm \\sqrt{2}.$\n\nHence, the solutions are $(1 + \\sqrt{2}, 1 - \\sqrt{2})$ and $(1 - \\sqrt{2}, 1 + \\sqrt{2}),$ and the final answer is\n\\[(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 + (1 - \\sqrt{2})^2 + (1 - \\sqrt{2})^2 + (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 = \\boxed{12}.\\]",

  "check_result": "the answer is 12. the problem asks for the sum of squares of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the roots. the reply contains an explanation, but no explicit answer. so the correct approach is to follow the explanation and execute the code to find the roots of the polynomial and then calculate the sum of squares of the coordinates:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import eq, symbols, solveset\n\nx = symbols('x', real=true)\np = x**5 + (2-x)**5 - 82\nroots_of_p = solveset(eq(p, 0), x, domain=symbols('s.reals'))\n\nsum_of_squares = 0\nfor root in roots_of_p:\n    x_val = float(root)\n    y_val = 2 - x_val\n    sum_of_squares += x_val**2 + y_val**2\n\nsum_of_squares\n```\n\nafter executing this code, the result should be 12, which matches the ground truth answer. therefore, i will choose the reply: \"the answer is correct.\"",
