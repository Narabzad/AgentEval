Problem 0 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 508

Reply: To solve this system of linear equations, we can use matrix operations. Let's represent the system as AX=B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables, and B is the column vector of constants.

Matrix A is:
```
[
 [1,  1,  1,  1,   1,   1],
 [1,  2,  3,  4,   2,   2],
 [1,  3,  6,  9,   4,   6],
 [1,  4, 10, 16,   8,  24],
 [1,  5, 15, 25,  16, 120]
]
```

Column vector B is:
```
[
 [0],
 [0],
 [0],
 [0],
 [42]
]
```

Column vector X is:
```
[
 [a],
 [b],
 [c],
 [d],
 [e],
 [f]
]
```

To find the values of a, b, c, d, e, and f, we can compute the inverse of matrix A and multiply it by B. Then, we can use these values to compute the desired expression: a + 6b + 21c + 36d + 32e + 720f.

Let's implement this in code.

Problem 1 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 4036

Reply: Let us now implement an iterative method to find the smallest n such that the condition holds:

```
sum_ak = 0
n = 1
a_n = 1

while a_n >= 1 / 2018:
    n += 1
    sum_ak += a_n
    a_n = (n**3 - 2 * n**2 + n) / (-2 * n + 1)
    
print(n)
```

This python code will iterate through values of n, starting from 2 (since n = 1 is not valid) and calculate the value of a_n for each n. It will break the loop when a_n becomes less than $\frac{1}{2018}$. At the end, it will print the smallest n for which the given condition holds.

Problem 2 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \left[ -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right]

Reply: We will find the set of possible values of the given expression step by step.

Step 1: We'll try to find the range of $x$ and $y$ by assuming $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, their range is from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.

Step 2: We'll rewrite the given expression and try to simplify it.

The expression is $\frac{(x + y)(1 - xy)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}$. Let's add and subtract $1$ in the numerator. We have:

$$\frac{(x+y)(1-xy) + 1 - 1}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)} = \frac{(x+y)(1-xy) + 1 - xy}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}$$

Now, observe that $1 - xy - 1 = -(xy)$, so we can rewrite the expression as:

$$\frac{(x+y)(1-xy) - (xy)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}$$

We'll simplify the numerator:

$$[(x + y) - (x + y)(xy)] - (xy) = x + y - x^2y - xy^2 - x^2 + x^2y - xy^2 - xy$$

Cancelling out $-x^2y + x^2y$ and regrouping, we have:

$$x (1 - y^2) + y (1 - x^2)$$

So our simplified expression is:

$$\frac{x(1-y^2) + y(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)}$$

Step 3: Since we have a simplified expression, let's analyze its behavior.

For $x = y$, the expression simplifies to:

$$\frac{x(1-x^2) + x(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)(1+x^2)}$$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}$.

For $x = -y$, the expression simplifies to:

$$\frac{x(1-y^2) - y(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)}$$, which simplifies to $0$.

Now let's consider other cases. Without loss of generality, assume that $x > 0$ and $y > 0$. In this case, $1 - x^2 < 0$ and $1 - y^2 < 0$. So, $(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)$ is positive. The numerator is the product of $(x + y)$ and $(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)$, which is positive. The denominator is the product of two positive numbers. So, the expression is always positive.

The converse also holds, and the product of $(x + y)$ and $(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)$ is always positive.

Thus, our expression ranges from $0$ to $\frac{1}{2}$.

So, the set of possible values of the expression is:

$$\left\{ \frac{(x + y)(1 - xy)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}: 0 \leq \frac{(x + y)(1 - xy)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)} \leq \frac{1}{2}\right\}$$

Reply: We can re-write the first equation as $y = 2 - x$. Let's plug this into the second equation:

$x^5 + (2-x)^5 = 82$

Now, let's define a polynomial $P(x) = x^5 + (2-x)^5 - 82$. We want to find the sum of squares of the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of the $n$ roots of $P(x)$.

Let's find the roots of $P(x)$ numerically.

```python

P = x**5 + (2-x)**5 - 82
roots_of_P = solveset(Eq(P, 0), x, domain=symbols('S.Reals'))

```

After finding the roots, we'll sum the squares of the coordinates $x_i$ and $y_i$, where $y_i = 2 - x_i$.

Check: the answer is 12. the problem asks for the sum of squares of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the roots. the reply contains an explanation, but no explicit answer. so the correct approach is to follow the explanation and execute the code to find the roots of the polynomial and then calculate the sum of squares of the coordinates:

```python
from sympy import eq, symbols, solveset

x = symbols('x', real=true)
p = x**5 + (2-x)**5 - 82
roots_of_p = solveset(eq(p, 0), x, domain=symbols('s.reals'))

sum_of_squares = 0
for root in roots_of_p:
    x_val = float(root)
    y_val = 2 - x_val
    sum_of_squares += x_val**2 + y_val**2

sum_of_squares

Problem 7 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 0

Reply: To find the maximum value of the given expression, let's first rewrite it using the absolute value of complex numbers.

$|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = |a + b|\cdot |a + c|\cdot |a + d|\cdot |b + c|\cdot |b + d|\cdot |c + d|$

Now, consider the vectors $a, b, c, d$ in the complex plane. Observe that the magnitude of $|a+b|$, for example, is the distance between $a$ and $-b$. So, the expression becomes the product of the distances between $a, b, c, d$ and their negations:

$|a+b|\cdot |a+c|\cdot |a+d|\cdot |b+c|\cdot |b+d|\cdot |c+d|$

Since $a + b + c + d = 0$, we can infer that the sum of the vectors representing these numbers must form a parallelogram in the complex plane. Let $A=a$, $B=-b$, $C=-c$, and $D=-d$. By the Parallelogram Law, the diagonals of a parallelogram are:

$AB+CD=BC+AD$

Using the identity $|(w+z)^2|=|w^2+z^2+2w\overline{z}|$ for complex numbers $w$ and $z$, we get:

$|AB|^2+|CD|^2=|BC|^2+|AD|^2$

$|AB|^2+|CD|^2+|AC|^2+|BD|^2=|BC|^2+|AD|^2+|AC|^2+|BD|^2$

$|AB|^2+|CD|^2+|AC|^2+|BD|^2=|AB|^2+|CD|^2+|BC|^2+|AD|^2+|AC|^2+|BD|^2-|BC|^2-|AD|^2$

$2|AB|^2+2|AC|^2=2|AB|^2+2|BC|^2$

$|AC|^2=|BC|^2$

Then we have $|AC| = |BC|$. Now, we need the expression to be maximized:

$|AB|\cdot |AC|\cdot |AD|\cdot |BC|\cdot |BD|\cdot |CD|$

Since all the numbers have magnitude 1, the parallelogram formed by $A, B, C, D$ is a rhombus.

To maximize the expression, $|AD|^2$ and $|BD|^2$ must be as large as possible. Consequently, $A, B, C, D$ must form a square.

In a square, the product of the diagonals is maximized when all sides are equal, so the maximum value occurs when all distances are equal:

$|AB| = |AC| = |AD| = |BC| = |BD| = |CD|$

Using the given information that $|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1$, we consider a square inscribed in a circle of radius 1.

For such a square, the side length is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{1}$, and hence the product of its diagonals is:

$|AB| \cdot |AC| \cdot |AD| \cdot |BC| \cdot |BD| \cdot |CD| = (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{1})^6 = 2^3 = 8$

So, the maximum value of the given expression is $8$.

Problem 8 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 14

Reply: We need to determine the least possible value of the absolute value of the second-to-last coefficient, $|a_{n-1}|$. We are given that $a_n = 2$ and $a_0 = 66$. The roots of the polynomial are distinct integers, meaning that we need to determine the polynomial with the smallest possible second-to-last coefficient as well as integer roots and the given coefficients for the first and last elements.

We can start by factoring out the leading coefficient ($2$) from the polynomial:

$$2(x^n + (\frac{1}{2}a_{n-1})x^{n-1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2}a_2x^2 + \frac{1}{2}a_1x + 33)$$

Now we have a monic polynomial with integer roots. Then, by Vieta's Formulas, the sum of the roots is the negative of the next coefficient:

$$s = -\frac{1}{2} a_{n-1}$$

We want the absolute value of $a_{n-1}$ to be as small as possible, so we want $s$ to be as close to $0$ as possible. Because the roots must be integers, let's consider cases with the smallest n.

If n = 1, we have one distinct integer root:

$$f(x) = 2x + 66$$

In this case, the only root is $-33$. However, there is only one root to this polynomial, and we cannot find the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$ because there is no $a_{n-1}$ ($n-1 = 0$).

Now let's consider n = 2:

$$f(x) = 2x^2 + a_1x + 66$$

The only even number that can be 66 when multiplied by an even number is $2 * 33$. So, we can try either $1$ and $-2$, or $-1$ and $2$ as roots, since the sum of the roots must be as close to $0$ as possible.

Let's try using the roots $1$ and $-2$:

The polynomial is:

$$f(x) = 2(x - 1)(x + 2) = 2(x^2 + x - 2)$$

In this case, $|a_{n-1}| = |1|$.

However, let's try the other possible pair of roots, $-1$ and $2$:

The polynomial is:

$$f(x) = 2(x + 1)(x - 2) = 2(x^2 - x - 2)$$

In this case, $|a_{n-1}| = |-1|$.

For both cases, the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$ is $1$. There is no need to check for greater values of $n$, as the sum of 3 or more integers will never be closer to 0 if the integers are distinct and they are not used in some of the cases above.

Therefore, the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$ is $1$.

Problem 10 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 9

Reply: We will use AM-GM inequality to solve this problem.

The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, their arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to their geometric mean, that is, 

$$\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \dots x_n}$$

Plan:
1. Apply AM-GM inequality to each of the four terms.
2. Add all inequalities and write the result.
3. Use the fact that $floor(x) \geq x - 1$ and rewrite the resulting inequality.
4. Find the minimal value of the left-hand side of the inequality.

Step 1. Apply AM-GM inequality:

For $\left\lfloor \frac{b + c + d}{a} \right\rfloor$, we have 
$$\frac{b + c + d}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{bcd} \Rightarrow \frac{b + c + d}{a} \geq \frac{\sqrt[3]{bcd}}{a}$$

Similarly,

$$\frac{a + c + d}{b} \geq \frac{\sqrt[3]{acd}}{b}$$

$$\frac{a + b + d}{c} \geq \frac{\sqrt[3]{abd}}{c}$$

$$\frac{a + b + c}{d} \geq \frac{\sqrt[3]{abc}}{d}$$

Step 2. Add all inequalities:

$$\left\lfloor \frac{b + c + d}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + c + d}{b} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + b + d}{c} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + b + c}{d} \right\rfloor \geq  \frac{\sqrt[3]{bcd}}{a} + \frac{\sqrt[3]{acd}}{b} + \frac{\sqrt[3]{abd}}{c} + \frac{\sqrt[3]{abc}}{d}$$

Step 3. Use the fact that $floor(x) \geq x - 1$:

$$\left\lfloor \frac{b + c + d}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + c + d}{b} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + b + d}{c} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + b + c}{d} \right\rfloor \geq  \frac{\sqrt[3]{bcd}}{a} + \frac{\sqrt[3]{acd}}{b} + \frac{\sqrt[3]{abd}}{c} + \frac{\sqrt[3]{abc}}{d} - 4$$

Step 4. Find the minimal value of the left-hand side of the inequality:

Let $a = b = c = d = 1$. Then, 

$$\left\lfloor \frac{1 + 1 + 1}{1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1 + 1 + 1}{1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1 + 1 + 1}{1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1 + 1 + 1}{1} \right\rfloor = 4$$

Hence, the minimum value is $\boxed{4}$.

Problem 12 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 214

Reply: It looks like I made another mistake in my reasoning. I apologize for that.

Let's revisit our equations:

$$(a + b)(a - b) = 19$$
$$(a + c)(a + d) = (p - b^2) + r$$
$$(b + c)(b + d) = (p - a^2) + r$$

The best strategy now is to find the values of $p$ and $r$ using algebraic methods:

We know that $(a - b)(a + b + 2c) = 19(a - b)$ and $(a - b)(a + b + 2d) = 19(a - b)$. 

Since $a - b ≠ 0$, we can divide by $(a - b)$, and we get:

$$a + b + 2c = 19$$
$$a + b + 2d = 19$$

Then, subtracting the first given equation $(a + b)(c + d) = 143$ from both equations above, we get:

$$2c - c d = 0 \implies c(2 - d) = 0$$
$$2d - c d = 0 \implies d(2 - c) = 0$$

Since $c$ and $d$ are positive numbers and can't be 0, we know that either $c = 2$ and $d = 1$, or $c = 1$ and $d = 2$. Now we can find $a$ and $b$ using these values. 

Finally, we can find $a$ and $b$ using the given equation $(a + b)(c + d) = 143$:

1. If $c = 1$ and $d = 2$: $(a + b)(3) = 143 \implies a + b = 47$ 
2. If $c = 2$ and $d = 1$: $(a + b)(3) = 143 \implies a + b = 47$ 

In both cases, we get the same sum $a + b = 47$. Replacing the found sum in $a^2 - b^2 = 19$ (which is the same as $(a + b)(a - b) = 19$), we get $(a - b) = \frac{19}{47}$. So, we have:

$$a = \frac{47 + \frac{19}{47}}{2} = \frac{47}{2} + \frac{19}{94} = \frac{66}{2} = 33$$
$$b = \frac{47 - \frac{19}{47}}{2} = \frac{47}{2} - \frac{19}{94} = \frac{14}{2} = 7$$

Now, we can find the smallest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$:

$$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 33^2 + 7^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1089 + 49 + 4 + 1 = 1143$$

Therefore, the smallest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ is 1143.

Reply: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of integers such that the polynomials $x^2 - ax + 24$ and $x^2 - bx + 36$ have one root in common.

Let's use Vieta's formulas to find the relationship between the roots of the polynomials and the sum and products of their roots.

Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the first polynomial, $x^2 - ax + 24$. Then:

1. $r_1 + r_2 = a$
2. $r_1 \cdot r_2 = 24$

Similarly, let the common root be $r_1$, and $r_3$ be the other root of the second polynomial, $x^2 - bx + 36$:

3. $r_1 + r_3 = b$
4. $r_1 \cdot r_3 = 36$

Now we can solve for the common root, $r_1$. From equations (2) and (4):

5. $r_1 = \frac{24}{r_2}$
6. $r_1 = \frac{36}{r_3}$

From equations (5) and (6):

7. $\frac{24}{r_2} = \frac{36}{r_3}$

As $r_2$ and $r_3$ are integers, there must be divisors of 24 and 36 to satisfy equation (7). Let's find the divisors of 24 and 36 and then use the relationship in equation (7) to find the ordered pairs $(a, b)$. 

```python

Problem 15 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{c}{a}

Reply: I made a mistake in my previous response. I apologize for any confusion. Let's go back and revisit the problem.

Let's use the x-intercepts of the parabola to eliminate one of the variables from the parabola's equation.

$0 = ap^2 + bp + c$

$0 = aq^2 + bq + c$

Subtract the first equation from the second:

$0 = a(q^2 - p^2) + b(q - p)$

Factor the left side:

$0 = (q - p)(a(p + q) + b)$

Given that $p$ and $q$ are distinct roots of the parabola, we know $q\neq p$. So, the following equation must hold true:

$a(p + q) + b = 0$

Now, we still have two unknowns ($a$ and $b$) and three equations (this new equation and the equations of the circle passing through $(p, 0)$ and $(q, 0)$). 

Let the center of the circle be $(h, 0)$. Then, the circle's equation is:

$(x - h)^2 + y^2 = r^2$

We know that the circle passes through the points $(p, 0)$ and $(q, 0)$. Plugging these points into the circle's equation gives us:

$(p - h)^2 = r^2$

$(q - h)^2 = r^2$

These two equations imply that $(p - h)^2 = (q - h)^2$. Solving for $h$, we get:

$h = \frac{p + q}{2}$

Now, let's substitute $h$ into the equations for the circle passing through $(p, 0)$:

$(p - \frac{p + q}{2})^2 = r^2$

Solving for $r^2$, we get:

$r^2 = \frac{(p - q)^2}{4}$

Now we have the expressions for $h$ and $r^2$ in terms of $p$ and $q$. Next, we'll express the length t of the tangent from the origin. Since the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius line connecting the center of the circle $(h, 0)$ to the origin, we get the following equation by the Pythagorean theorem:

$t^2 = r^2 + h^2$

Substitute with the expressions we found for $h$ and $r^2$:

$t^2 = \frac{(p - q)^2}{4} + \left(\frac{p + q}{2}\right)^2$

We have an expression for $t^2$ in terms of $p$ and $q$:

$t^2 = \frac{(p - q)^2}{4} + \frac{(p + q)^2}{4}$

This is the final expression for $t^2$.

Problem 17 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \sqrt{2}

Reply: Before we move to matplotlib, I need to first install the matplotlib package. In order to install matplotlib, please execute the following code:

```python
!pip install matplotlib
```

After installing matplotlib, you can plot the function using the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def f(x):
    return np.sqrt(-(x - 2)**2 + 25) - np.sqrt(-(x - 3/2)**2 + 49/4)

x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)
y = f(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("f(x)")
plt.title("Graph of f(x)")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This will output the graph of f(x). Based on the graph, we will determine a possible range for the minimum value of the function and then use an optimization method to find the minimum value precisely within that range.

Problem 18 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 10

Reply: Our goal is to find the possible combinations of coefficients that satisfy the conditions.

1. For \(a_0^2 = a_0\), we have two possibilities: \(a_0 = 0\) or \(a_0 = 1\). In both cases, \(a_4\neq 0\).

2. If \(a_0 = 0\), the equation becomes:

\((a_4x^4 + a_2x^2)(a_4x^4 - a_2x^2) = a_4x^8 + (-a_4^2 + a_2^2)x^4\).

From condition 3, we have \(a_2^2 - a_4^2 = -a_4^2\), which simplifies to \(a_2 = 0\). So in this case, we have a single polynomial \(P(x) = a_4x^4\).

3. If \(a_0 = 1\), the equation becomes:

\((a_4x^4 + a_2x^2 + 1)(a_4x^4 - a_2x^2 + 1) = a_4x^8 + (a_2^2 - a_4^2 + 2)a_4x^4 + 1\).

From condition 3, we have \(a_2^2 - a_4^2 + 2a_4 = a_4\), which simplifies to \(a_2^2 = 2a_4\).

If \(a_2 = 0\), then \(a_4 = 0\), which is not allowed. So, \(a_2\neq 0\). Since \(a_4 = \frac{a_2^2}{2}\), we know that \(a_2\) can be any nonzero real number, and \(a_4\) is uniquely determined. So in this case, we have infinitely many possible non-zero values for \(a_2\), which result in infinitely many polynomials \(P(x) = a_4x^4 + a_2x^2 + 1\).

To summarize, there is one polynomial when \(a_0 = 0\) (\(P(x) = a_4x^4\)), and there are infinitely many polynomials when \(a_0 = 1\) (\(P(x) = a_4x^4 + a_2x^2 + 1\)). Thus, there are an infinite number of polynomials of degree 4 with real coefficients that satisfy the given condition.

Reply: Let's iterate through values of N to find the smallest number that satisfies the condition. We'll start with N = 27, as there are 27 candidates.

```python
def find_smallest_committee():
    N = 27  # Starting from 27 as we have 27 candidates
    found = False
    while not found:
        sum_votes = 0
        for n_i in range(1, 28):
            if 100 * n_i // N < n_i:
                sum_votes += n_i
            else:
                break
        if sum_votes == N:
            found = True
        else:
            N += 27  # Incrementing N by 27, assuming every candidate gets at least 1 vote
    return N

smallest_committee = find_smallest_committee()
print(smallest_committee)
```

Please execute the above code to find the smallest possible number of members of the committee.
