Let's first define a function for the expression:\n\nf(x, y) = x^4 * y + x * y^4, with x + y = 1.\n\nWe will now try to find the maximum of this function using Python and the library Scipy which has optimization tools.\nWe will need to rewrite our constraint since the Scipy optimizer we will use only supports bounds on variables. Given that x and y are nonnegative, we can write the constraint as:\n\n0 <= x <= 1\n0 <= y <= 1\n\nand find the maximum value of f(x,y).",
