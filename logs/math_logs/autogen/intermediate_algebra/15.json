      "content": "First, let us find the equation of the circle. Given that the circle goes through points $(p, 0)$ and $(q, 0)$, we know that the circle is bisected by the x-axis. Thus, the center of the circle lies on the x-axis at some point $(h, 0)$. Let the radius of the circle be r. Hence, the equation of the circle is $(x - h)^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\n\nNow, we need to use the fact that the circle goes through $(p, 0)$ and $(q, 0)$, which are the x-intercepts of the parabola. The x-intercepts are given by setting $y = 0$:\n\n$0 = ax^2 + bx + c$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$0 = ap^2 + bp + c$\n\n$0 = aq^2 + bq + c$\n\nWe know that the points $(p, 0)$ and $(q, 0)$ also lie on the circle, so we can plug these points into the circle's equation:\n\n$(p - h)^2 = r^2$\n\n$(q - h)^2 = r^2$\n\nNow we have 4 equations and 4 unknowns $(a, h, p, q)$. The only information we are missing is that the circle is tangent to the y-axis. We can find the equation for the tangent line from the origin, which has the equation $y = mx$ for some slope m. Since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius, we can find the slope of the radius:\n\n$m_r = -\\frac{1}{m_t} = -\\frac{h}{r}$\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\n$y - 0 = m_r(x - h)$\n\nLet's find the value of $y$ when $x = p$ and when $x = q$:\n\n$0 - 0 = m_r(p - h)$\n\n$0 - 0 = m_r(q - h)$\n\nWe can combine these equations with the first two equations to solve for a, b, and c.\n",
