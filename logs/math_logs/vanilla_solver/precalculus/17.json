  "solution": "Suppose $P = (x,y,z)$ is a point that lies on a plane that bisects the angle between the planes $3x - 6y + 2z + 5 = 0$ and $4x - 12y + 3z - 3 = 0.$  (Note that there are two such bisecting planes.)  Then the distance from $P$ to both planes must be equal, so\n\\[\\frac{|3x - 6y + 2z + 5|}{\\sqrt{3^2 + (-6)^2 + 2^2}} = \\frac{|4x - 12y + 3z - 3|}{\\sqrt{4^2 + (-12)^2 + 3^2}}.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{|3x - 6y + 2z + 5|}{7} = \\frac{|4x - 12y + 3z - 3|}{13}.\\]We want to remove the absolute value signs, in order to obtain the equation of a plane.  Checking the sign of both sides when $(x,y,z) = (-5,-1,-5)$ leads us to\n\\[\\frac{3x - 6y + 2z + 5}{7} = \\frac{4x - 12y + 3z - 3}{13}.\\]This simplifies to $\\boxed{11x + 6y + 5z + 86 = 0}.$",

  "response_with_ans": "The normal vectors of the given planes $3x - 6y + 2z + 5 = 0$ and $4x - 12y + 3z - 3 = 0$ are $(3, -6, 2)$ and $(4, -12, 3)$ respectively. \n\nLet's divide these vectors by their lengths, to convert them into unit vectors.\n\nThe length of the vector $(3, -6, 2)$ is $\\sqrt{3^2 + (-6)^2 + 2^2} = 7,$ so the unit vector in the direction of $(3, -6, 2)$ is $(3/7, -6/7, 2/7).$\n\nThe length of the vector $(4, -12, 3)$ is $\\sqrt{4^2 + (-12)^2 + 3^2} = 13,$ so the unit vector in the direction of $(4, -12, 3)$ is $(4/13, -12/13, 3/13).$\n\nNow, the normal vector to the plane which bisects the angle between the given planes is either the sum or the difference of these two unit vectors. It is the sum if the acute angle is to be bisected and the difference if the obtuse angle is to be bisected.\n\nWe suppose first that we need to find the plane bisecting the acute angle.\n\nAdding the unit vectors gives $(3/7 + 4/13, -6/7 - 12/13, 2/7 + 3/13).$ That simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{61}{91}, \\frac{-138}{91}, \\frac{37}{91}\\right)$. Multiplying these entries by 91 to clear the denominator, we get $(61, -138, 37)$ as the normal to the plane we're looking for.\n\nThen, to find the constant term in the plane equation, we substitute the point $(-5,-1,-5)$ which the plane contains into the equation of the plane in normal form, which gives the equation of the plane as \n\n$61x - 138y + 37z - (-305 + 138 - 185) = 0.$  This simplifies to $\\boxed{61x - 138y + 37z - 352 = 0}.$\nIf the plane that bisects the obtuse angle is desired, we use the difference of the unit normal vectors, which would proceed analogously.",
