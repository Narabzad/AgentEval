Therefore, the line $\\ell$ is parametrized as $\\left(\\frac{z-1}{1}, \\frac{z-1}{1}, z\\right)$ for $z \\ge 0$.\n\nLet $(x,y,z)$ be the point on the line $\\ell$ that we travel to. Since $(x,y,z)$ lies on the line $\\ell$, we'll use $z$ to represent this point $(x, y, z)$ based on the parameterisation i.e., $\\left(\\frac{z-1}{1}, \\frac{z-1}{1}, z\\right)$.\n\nTo find the shortest possible path, we calculate the total distance from the origin to $(x,y,z)$ and then to $(1,0,0)$, and then take the derivative with respect to $z$, and set it to zero to find the minimum.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the point $(x,y,z)$ is\n\\[\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} = \\sqrt{(z-1)^2+(z-1)^2+z^2} = \\sqrt{3z^2-4z+2},\\]\nand the distance from $(x,y,z)$ to $(1,0,0)$ is\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+y^2+0^2} = \\sqrt{(z-1)^2+(1-z)^2} = \\sqrt{2-2z}.\\]\n\nSo the total distance $d$ as a function of $z$ is\n\\[d(z) = \\sqrt{3z^2-4z+2} + \\sqrt{2-2z}.\\]\nNow we need to minimize this function for $z$ over the interval $[0,1]$. \n\nTaking the derivative of $d$ with respect to $z$ (using the chain rule), setting the derivative equal to zero, and simplifying, we get:\n\\[2z-1=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2-2z}}.\\]\n\nSquaring both sides, we get $4z^2 - 4z + 1 = 2 - 2z$ which simplifies to $4z^2 - 2z - 1 = 0$.\n\nSolving for $z$ gives $z = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}}{4}$. Given $z$ is within the range $[0, 1]$, we keep the solution $z = \\frac{1 +\\sqrt{2}}{4}$. \n\nSubstitute $z = \\frac{1 +\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ back into the distance function $d(z)$ and then square the result to get $d^2$:\n\\[d^2 \\approx (\\sqrt{3(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{4})^2-4(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{4})+2} + \\sqrt{2-2(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{4})})^2 \\approx 1.\\]",
