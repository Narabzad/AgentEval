  "response_with_ans": "This specific recursive sequence forms a cycle, meaning that somewhere down the line, the sequence begins to repeat. The question asks for how many starting values will the sequence return to the initial value after 2007 iterations.\n\nLet's analyze the recursive definition: $a_{n+1} = a_n^3 - 3a_n^2 + 3$. This equation is equivalent to $(a_n - 1)^3 = a_{n+1} - 1$, and all real solutions to the equation $(a_n-1)^3 = x$ are values of $a_n$ that map to $x+1$ under the given recursion. Therefore, unless $a_0 = 1$, the sequence $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, ... must eventually hit the value $1$ because $1$ is the only real cube root of $1$.\n\nIf $a_0 = 1$, then $a_1 = 1^3 - 3*1^2 + 3 = 1$ as well and the sequence is constant and equals $1$ for all $n$.\n\nIf $a_0 \\neq 1$, the sequence must hit $1$ at some point, and once it hits $1$, it will remain constant at $1$ from that point forward.\n\nSince we have to find the points when $a_{2007} = a_0$, the possible values of $a_0$ are only $1$, when it hits the same value at all steps, and when $a_2007$ reaches 1 for the first time, meaning the initial value was such that it took 2007 steps to reach 1.\n\nHence, the answer to the problem is $2$, there are only two values of $a_0$ that satisfy $a_{2007} = a_0$: when $a_0$ is $1$ or a particular value - both of these making such that after 2007 steps it returns to the initial value. The specific value that takes 2007 steps to reach 1 from a different initial value is not asked for in the question and can be quite complex to find as the iterations progress in a nonlinear fashion.",
