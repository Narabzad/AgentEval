  "response_with_ans": "We know the half-angle identity : $\\tan(\\theta/2) = \\frac{1-\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$ (which can be derived from the double-angle identity $\\cos \\theta = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 (\\theta/2)$).\n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as \n$$\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan \\left(90^{\\circ} - \\frac{50^{\\circ}}{2}\\right),$$\nas both sides are now in the form of $\\tan y$ for some $y$, the two $y$'s must differ by a multiple of $180^\\circ$. In other words there is an integer $n$ such that\n\\begin{align*}\nx - 160^\\circ &= 90^\\circ -  25^\\circ + 180^\\circ n \\\\\nx &= 185^\\circ + 180^\\circ n \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe are looking for the smallest positive solution $x$, which makes $n = 0$ and hence $x = \\boxed{185}$ degrees.",
