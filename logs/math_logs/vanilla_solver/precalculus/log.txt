Problem 0 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 32R^2 - 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)

Reply: First of all, let's interpret the meaning of the given common value. Because of the uniqueness of point $P$, it must be the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$ which is the center of the circumscribed circle. Hence, $AP=BP=CP=2R$ where $R$ is the circumradius of the triangle.

Substitute $AP=BP=CP=2R$ into the given equations, and we get these 3 equations:
\[AB^2 + 4R^2 = AC^2 + 4R^2 = BC^2 + 4R^2.\]

Subtracting $4R^2$ from each side, we get:
\[AB^2 = AC^2 = BC^2.\]

Consider that $AB=b, BC=a, AC=c$, we have:
\[b^2 = c^2 = a^2.\]

These lead to the conclusion that $\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle with $a = b = c$.

Now, we know the relation between the side length and circumradius of an equilateral triangle is $a = 2R\sqrt{3}$.

Therefore, the common value can be expressed in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, $R$:
\[AB^2 + AP^2 + BP^2 = a^2 + 4R^2.\]
Substitute $a = 2R\sqrt{3}$, we get
\[a^2 + 4R^2 = 12R^2 = 4a^2.\]

So, the common value can be expressed as $4a^2$ (or $4b^2$ or $4c^2$), given $\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle.
%%%%%%%
Check: the answer extracted from the reply is: "the common value can be expressed as $4a^2$ (or $4b^2$ or $4c^2$), given triangle abc is an equilateral triangle."

this extracted answer doesn't match the ground truth value of $32r^2 - 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.

the reply has assumed that the triangle is equilateral, however, the problem statement doesn't specify this. given that the ground truth response takes into account the three unique side lengths, a, b and c, it suggests that the triangle could potentially also be scalene or isosceles. therefore, the reply is incorrect by incorrectly assuming that the triangle is equilateral.

therefore, the final response is: "the answer is incorrect. correct answer: $32r^2 - 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$ | answer extracted: $4a^2$ (or $4b^2$ or $4c^2$)."

Problem 1 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 432

Reply: We will use the fact that for any $n \neq 0,$
\[1 + \omega^n + \omega^{2n} + \omega^{3n} = \frac{1 - \omega^{4n}}{1 - \omega^n}.\]
Then if $4n$ is not a multiple of 1729, the numerator is 0, so the term in the sum is 0.  If $4n$ is a multiple of 1729, then $n$ is a multiple of $1729/4 = 432.25,$ but $n$ is an integer, so $n$ must be a multiple of 1732.

Hence, the only nonzero terms correspond to $n = 432,$ 864, 1296, and 1632, and these terms are
\[\frac{1}{1 - \omega^{432}} + \frac{1}{1 - \omega^{864}} + \frac{1}{1 - \omega^{1296}} + \frac{1}{1 - \omega^{1632}}.\]
Then
\[\frac{1}{1 - \omega^{432}} + \frac{1}{1 - \omega^{864}} = \frac{1 - \omega^{864} + 1 - \omega^{432}}{(1 - \omega^{432})(1 - \omega^{864})} = \frac{2(1 - \omega^{432})}{(1 - \omega^2)^2} = 2,\]
and
\[\frac{1}{1 - \omega^{1296}} + \frac{1}{1 - \omega^{1632}} = 2.\]
Therefore, the sum of all the terms is $\boxed{4}$.

Problem 2 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 159

Reply: We know that $\tan(45^{\circ} + x) = \frac{\sin(45^{\circ} + x)}{\cos(45^{\circ} + x)} = \frac{\sin{45^{\circ}}\cos{x} + \cos{45^{\circ}}\sin{x}}{\cos{45^{\circ}}\cos{x} - \sin{45^{\circ}}\sin{x}}$
This equals to $\frac{\cos x + \sin x}{\cos x - \sin x}$ because $\sin 45^{\circ}$ and $\cos 45^{\circ}$ are both equal to $\sqrt{2}/2$.

Therefore, we can conclude that the equation $\tan{19x^{\circ}}=\dfrac{\cos{96^{\circ}}+\sin{96^{\circ}}}{\cos{96^{\circ}}-\sin{96^{\circ}}}$ is equivalent to  $\tan{19x^{\circ}} = \tan{45^{\circ} + 96^{\circ}}$.

We can say that $19x = 45 + 96 + k*180$ where k is an integer, because the tan function has a period of 180°. 

So $19x = 141 + k*180$, the smallest positive integer solution happens when k=0, hence we get $19x = 141$ and thus $x = 141 / 19 = 7.421052631...$.

Since we are looking for an integer solution, we take the nearest integer value which gives us $7$. 

Hence, the smallest positive integer solution to the given equation is $7$.

Problem 3 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 2, -1

Reply: First, note that $\mathbf{M}^3 = \mathbf{I}$ implies that the cubic polynomial $x^3 - 1$ annihilates $\mathbf{M},$ so the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}$ are the roots of $x^3 - 1,$ which are $1,$ $-1/2 + \sqrt{3}i/2,$ and $-1/2 - \sqrt{3}i/2.$ For any $2 \times 2$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2,$ the trace of $\mathbf{A}$ is equal to $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2.$ So, the possible values for the trace of $\mathbf{M}$ (which is just $a + d$) are 

1 + 1 = 2, 
1 + (-1/2 + \sqrt{3}i/2) = 1/2 + \sqrt{3}i/2, 
1 + (-1/2 - \sqrt{3}i/2) = 1/2 - \sqrt{3}i/2,
(-1/2 + \sqrt{3}i/2) + (-1/2 - \sqrt{3}i/2) = -1.

This gives that the possible values for $a + d$ are 2, -1. As $a$ and $d$ are real, the options with imaginary components can be discarded. So the possible values of $a + d,$ are -1 and 2.

Problem 4 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 3 + \sqrt{6}

Reply: The direction vector of the line $\ell$ is given by $(1,1,1) - (0,0,1) = (1,1,0)$. Therefore, the line $\ell$ is parametrized as $\left(\frac{z-1}{1}, \frac{z-1}{1}, z\right)$ for $z \ge 0$.

Let $(x,y,z)$ be the point on the line $\ell$ that we travel to. Since $(x,y,z)$ lies on the line $\ell$, we'll use $z$ to represent this point $(x, y, z)$ based on the parameterisation i.e., $\left(\frac{z-1}{1}, \frac{z-1}{1}, z\right)$.

To find the shortest possible path, we calculate the total distance from the origin to $(x,y,z)$ and then to $(1,0,0)$, and then take the derivative with respect to $z$, and set it to zero to find the minimum.

The distance from the origin to the point $(x,y,z)$ is
\[\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} = \sqrt{(z-1)^2+(z-1)^2+z^2} = \sqrt{3z^2-4z+2},\]
and the distance from $(x,y,z)$ to $(1,0,0)$ is
\[\sqrt{(x-1)^2+y^2+0^2} = \sqrt{(z-1)^2+(1-z)^2} = \sqrt{2-2z}.\]

So the total distance $d$ as a function of $z$ is
\[d(z) = \sqrt{3z^2-4z+2} + \sqrt{2-2z}.\]
Now we need to minimize this function for $z$ over the interval $[0,1]$. 

Taking the derivative of $d$ with respect to $z$ (using the chain rule), setting the derivative equal to zero, and simplifying, we get:
\[2z-1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2-2z}}.\]

Squaring both sides, we get $4z^2 - 4z + 1 = 2 - 2z$ which simplifies to $4z^2 - 2z - 1 = 0$.

Solving for $z$ gives $z = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2}}{4}$. Given $z$ is within the range $[0, 1]$, we keep the solution $z = \frac{1 +\sqrt{2}}{4}$. 

Substitute $z = \frac{1 +\sqrt{2}}{4}$ back into the distance function $d(z)$ and then square the result to get $d^2$:
\[d^2 \approx (\sqrt{3(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{4})^2-4(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{4})+2} + \sqrt{2-2(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{4})})^2 \approx 1.\]

Problem 6 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{9}{2}

Reply: The volume of a parallelepiped spanned by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$ is given by the scalar triple product $\|\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})\|$.

The dot product of two vectors is given by $|\mathbf{x}| |\mathbf{y}| \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$. In this case, we have $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{c} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cos\left(\arccos \frac{5}{8}\right) = 20/8 = 5/2$.

The cross product of two vectors, in magnitude, equals the area of the parallelogram they form, so $\|\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\| = \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| \sin \theta = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \sin\left(\arccos \frac{5}{8}\right)$. You can use a trigonometric identity here, namely $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$, to find $\sin\theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{5}{8}\right)^2} = \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{8}$.

Substituting back, we get $\|\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\| = \frac{6\sqrt{7}}{2} = 3\sqrt{7}$.

Finally, the volume of the parallelepiped is $\|\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\| \cdot \cos \theta = 2 \cdot 3\sqrt{7} \cdot \frac{5}{8} = \frac{15\sqrt{7}}{4}$, which is the answer.

Problem 7 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{5 \sqrt{6}}{3}

Reply: We start by visualizing the set $S$ in 3-dimensional space. It includes every point inside a sphere of radius 5 and all points above the $xy$-plane. This region is a half-sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin.

To find the largest cube that can fit into this half-sphere, we can think about the diagonal of the cube. The cube diagonal will be a diameter of the sphere, and since the cube lies entirely above the $xy$-plane, its diagonal will lie along the positive $z$-axis.

A cube of side length $a$ will have a diagonal of length $a\sqrt{3}$. Since the diagonal needs to be the diameter of the sphere, i.e., twice the radius, we must have $a\sqrt{3} = 2 \cdot 5 = 10$. 

Therefore, the side length $a$ of the cube is:

$$a = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}.$$ Hence, the side length of the largest cube contained in $S$ is $\frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
%%%%%%%
Check: the answer in the reply is: $\frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

firstly, check whether the answer in the reply matches the ground truth answer:

to simplify the ground truth answer, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{3}$ in the fraction $\frac{5 \sqrt{6}}{3}$, which converts it to $\frac{5\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

now comparing the converted ground truth answer with the answer in the reply, we see that the concept is incorrect. the answer in the reply divides the diagonal of the sphere (which is the diameter, 10 units) directly by $\sqrt{3}$, this will result in cube's side length. but in the ground truth, the diagonal of the sphere is divided by $\sqrt{2}$ to get the side length of the cube, because the relation between side(length) of cube and its diagonal is $a\sqrt{2}$ (not $a\sqrt{3}$). hence, it's conceptually incorrect.

therefore, the final verdict is: "the answer is incorrect. correct answer: $\frac{5 \sqrt{6}}{3}$ | answer extracted: $\frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}$."

Problem 8 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 43

Reply: A complex number $z$ with $z^{13} = 1$ is of the form $z = \operatorname{cis} \theta$ where $\theta = \frac{2 \pi k}{13}$ for $k = 0,1,2, \ldots, 12.$

We have
\begin{align*}
z + z^3 + z^4 + z^9 + z^{10} + z^{12} &= \operatorname{cis} \theta + \operatorname{cis} 3\theta + \operatorname{cis} 4\theta + \operatorname{cis} 9\theta + \operatorname{cis} 10\theta + \operatorname{cis} 12\theta \\
&= \operatorname{cis} \theta (1 + \operatorname{cis}2\theta + \operatorname{cis}3\theta + \operatorname{cis}8\theta + \operatorname{cis}9\theta + \operatorname{cis}11\theta),
\end{align*}as $\operatorname{cis}13\theta = \operatorname{cis}\theta.$

Thus, the $w_i$ are just scalings of the values the expression $1 + \operatorname{cis}2\theta + \operatorname{cis}3\theta + \operatorname{cis}8\theta + \operatorname{cis}9\theta + \operatorname{cis}11\theta$ takes on when $\theta = \frac{2 \pi k}{13}$ for $k = 0,1,2, \ldots, 12.$ 

One sees then these terms $1 + \operatorname{cis}2\theta + \operatorname{cis}3\theta + \operatorname{cis}8\theta + \operatorname{cis}9\theta + \operatorname{cis}11\theta$ come as complex conjugate pairs when $k = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 6,$ $k = 7$ corresponding to the real term $1 + \operatorname{cis}2\theta + \operatorname{cis}3\theta + \operatorname{cis}8\theta + \operatorname{cis}9\theta + \operatorname{cis}11\theta.$

Thus, we need only compute these values for half the total values of $\theta,$ squaring the resulting numbers, and doubling the sum.

For $k = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,$ we get the following values: 

$1 + 6 = 7,$

$1 + \cos \frac{2\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{4\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{16\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{18\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{22\pi}{13} = -\cos \frac{2\pi}{13} + 1,$

$1 + \cos \frac{4\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{8\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{12\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{2\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{4\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{10\pi}{13} = -1,$

$1 + \cos \frac{6\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{12\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{18\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{4\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{8\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{16\pi}{13} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{13} - 2,$

$1 + \cos \frac{8\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{16\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{6\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{12\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{22\pi}{13} = -1,$

$1 + \cos \frac{10\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{20\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{8\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{16\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{10\pi}{13} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{13} - 2,$

$1 + \cos \frac{12\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{24\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{10\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{10\pi}{13} +\cos \frac{20\pi}{13} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{13} = -\cos \frac{2\pi}{13} + 1.$

Summing the squares of these values, we get
\[7^2 + (-\cos \frac{2\pi}{13} + 1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (\cos \frac{2\pi}{13} - 2)^2 + (-1)^2 + (\cos \frac{2\pi}{13} - 2)^2 + (-\cos \frac{2\pi}{13} + 1)^2 = 61.\]Multiplying by 2 and adding on the final case when $k = 7$ gives a final result of $\boxed{122}$.

$-tan \left( \frac{(B - C) + (C - A)}{2} \right) = -tan \frac{A + B}{2} = tan \frac{C}{2} = -29.$

as both sides are now in the form of $\tan y$ for some $y$, the two $y$'s must differ by a multiple of $180^\circ$. In other words there is an integer $n$ such that

Reply: Without loss of generality, we can say that $\angle A \leq \angle B \leq \angle C.$

If $\angle A = \angle B = \angle C = 60^\circ,$ then $AB = BC,$ so the altitude from $B$ to $\overline{AC}$ is 0, and $\sin \frac{C - A}{2} = 0.$

Otherwise, $\angle C > \angle B,$ so angle $\angle B$ must be acute.  Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $\overline{AC},$ and let $x = BC$ and $y = BD.$

[asy]
unitsize (2 cm);

pair A, B, C, D;

A = dir(127.5);

[/asy]

Since $\angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ$ and they form an arithmetic sequence, $\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ,$ so $BC = BD.$  This means $AB = AD = x + y.$

Then by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABD,$
\[BD^2 = AB^2 - AD^2 = (x + y)^2 - y^2 = 2xy + x^2.\]Since $BD = BC = x$ and $AB = AD = x + y,$ we get
\[x^2 = 2xy + x^2,\]so $y = 0.$  But this means $AB = BC,$ contradiction.

Therefore, the only possible value of $\sin \frac{C - A}{2}$ is $\boxed{0}.$

Problem 12 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 3R^2

Reply: The problem can be resolved by using Euler's theorem, which states that the distance between the orthocenter (H) and the circumcenter (O) of a triangle is twice the distance between its circumcenter and centroid (G).

Let $R$ denotes the circumradius of triangle $ABC,$ and $OG$, $OH$ denote the distances from $O$ to $G$ and $H$, respectively. By Euler's theorem, we have $2OG = OH$.

Furthermore, the centroid $G$ splits medians of the triangle into segments of ratio $2 : 1$. Meaning the distance between circumcentre (O) and centroid (G) is $\frac{R}{3}$.

This implies that $2OG = OH = \frac{2R}{3}$ and $OG = \frac{R}{3}$.

The problem asks for $AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2 = AG^2 + BG^2 + CG^2 - 3GF^2$.

By the Law of Cosines applied to triangle $ABC$, we have
$$AG^2 + BG^2 + CG^2 = BC^2 + CA^2 + AB^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).$$

Taking into account that $GF$ = $\frac{OG}{2}$ = $\frac{R}{6}$, we get
$$AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2 = 2 (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 3 \left(\frac{R}{6}\right)^2 = 2 (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - \frac{R^2}{12}.$$

Also, knowing that in a triangle, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2R^2 - r^2$, where $r$ is the inradius of the triangle, we substitute $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ in the previous equation to obtain 
$$AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2 = 2 \left(2R^2 - r^2\right) - \frac{R^2}{12} = \frac{3R^2}{2} - 4r^2.$$

Problem 13 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 2 \sqrt{2}

Reply: We can re-arrange the equation, apply the identity $\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta$, rearrange once again, and apply the identities $\cos 2\theta = 2\cos^2 \theta - 1$ and $\sin 2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta$.

First, note that $\sin 5\theta = \sin^5\theta$ means that for some integer $k$,
\[
5\theta = \begin{cases}
k\pi + (-1)^k \theta, & \text{if } \sin^5\theta \geq 0, \\
k\pi + \pi + (-1)^k \theta, & \text{if } \sin^5\theta < 0.
\end{cases}
\]
Since $\theta$ is acute, $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$, and therefore $\sin^5\theta \geq 0$. Then we get
\[
5\theta = k\pi + (-1)^k \theta.
\]
Taking modulo $2\pi$, we have $5\theta = (-1)^k \theta$, which gives $\theta = 0$ when $k$ is odd or $4\theta = 0$ when $k$ is even. Since $\theta$ is a non-zero acute angle, we must have $k$ even and therefore $\sin 5\theta = \sin \theta$.

Then we can re-write $\sin 5 \theta = \sin \theta$ as $\sin 4 \theta = 0$ which means $4 \theta = n \pi$ for some integer $n$. Since $\theta$ is acute, $0 < 4\theta < 2 \pi$. Hence, the possible values of $4\theta$ are $\theta = 0$, $\theta = \pi$, and $\theta = 2\pi$. Discarding $0$ and $2\pi$ (because $\theta$ is non-zero and less than $\pi / 2$), we get $\theta = \pi / 4$. 

Therefore, $\tan 2 \theta = \tan (2 \cdot \pi / 4) = \tan (\pi / 2) = \boxed{-1}$

Problem 14 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 9

Reply: From the parametric equations $x = \sin t$ and $y = \sin 2t$, we know that $y = 2\sin t\cos t = 2x\sqrt{1-x^2}$.

Squaring both sides gives $y^2 = 4x^2(1 - x^2) = 4x^2 - 4x^4$. 

We want this in the form $ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0$, so rearranging gives $4x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 0$.

By dividing through by 4 we can minimize the values of $a$, $b$ and $c$: $x^4 - x^2 + \frac{1}{4}y^2 = 0$.

Hence, $a = 1$, $b = 1$ and $c = 1/4$, so the smallest possible value of $a + b + c$ is $1 + 1 + 1/4 = 2.25$.

Problem 15 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 1, -3

Reply: The equation $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & -3 & 2 \\ -1 & 2 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} = k \mathbf{v}$ can be rewritten as 
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & -3 & 2 \\ -1 & 2 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} - k \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0},\]
which is further rewritten as 
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2-k & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & -3-k & 2 \\ -1 & 2 & -k \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}.\]
or
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2-k & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & -3-k & 2 \\ -1 & 2 & -k \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]
This has a nontrivial solution if and only if the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 2-k & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & -3-k & 2 \\ -1 & 2 & -k \end{pmatrix}$ is not of full rank, i.e., its determinant is $0.$  Hence, we find the determinant
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2-k & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & -3-k & 2 \\ -1 & 2 & -k \end{vmatrix} = -(2-k)(-k^2 -k - 6)+2(2k-2)-(-2-k)=0.\]
This simplifies to $-k^3 + 3k^2 + 4k - 12 = 0$, or $k^3 - 3k^2 - 4k + 12 = 0$.

We know that if $r$ is a root of a cubic equation, we can factor that cubic equation by $(x-r)$. Testing $k=1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, 4, -4$ , we find that one of the roots are $k=1, 2, -6$. Therefore, we can factor the polynomial as $(k-1)(k-2)(k+6)=0$. 

So, the values of $k$ for which there exist a nonzero vector $\mathbf{v}$ such that $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & -3 & 2 \\ -1 & 2 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} = k \mathbf{v}$ are $k = 1, 2, -6$.

Problem 16 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 3^{2007}

Reply: This specific recursive sequence forms a cycle, meaning that somewhere down the line, the sequence begins to repeat. The question asks for how many starting values will the sequence return to the initial value after 2007 iterations.

Let's analyze the recursive definition: $a_{n+1} = a_n^3 - 3a_n^2 + 3$. This equation is equivalent to $(a_n - 1)^3 = a_{n+1} - 1$, and all real solutions to the equation $(a_n-1)^3 = x$ are values of $a_n$ that map to $x+1$ under the given recursion. Therefore, unless $a_0 = 1$, the sequence $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, ... must eventually hit the value $1$ because $1$ is the only real cube root of $1$.

If $a_0 = 1$, then $a_1 = 1^3 - 3*1^2 + 3 = 1$ as well and the sequence is constant and equals $1$ for all $n$.

If $a_0 \neq 1$, the sequence must hit $1$ at some point, and once it hits $1$, it will remain constant at $1$ from that point forward.

Since we have to find the points when $a_{2007} = a_0$, the possible values of $a_0$ are only $1$, when it hits the same value at all steps, and when $a_2007$ reaches 1 for the first time, meaning the initial value was such that it took 2007 steps to reach 1.

Hence, the answer to the problem is $2$, there are only two values of $a_0$ that satisfy $a_{2007} = a_0$: when $a_0$ is $1$ or a particular value - both of these making such that after 2007 steps it returns to the initial value. The specific value that takes 2007 steps to reach 1 from a different initial value is not asked for in the question and can be quite complex to find as the iterations progress in a nonlinear fashion.

Problem 17 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 11x + 6y + 5z + 86 = 0

Reply: The normal vectors of the given planes $3x - 6y + 2z + 5 = 0$ and $4x - 12y + 3z - 3 = 0$ are $(3, -6, 2)$ and $(4, -12, 3)$ respectively. 

Let's divide these vectors by their lengths, to convert them into unit vectors.

The length of the vector $(3, -6, 2)$ is $\sqrt{3^2 + (-6)^2 + 2^2} = 7,$ so the unit vector in the direction of $(3, -6, 2)$ is $(3/7, -6/7, 2/7).$

The length of the vector $(4, -12, 3)$ is $\sqrt{4^2 + (-12)^2 + 3^2} = 13,$ so the unit vector in the direction of $(4, -12, 3)$ is $(4/13, -12/13, 3/13).$

Now, the normal vector to the plane which bisects the angle between the given planes is either the sum or the difference of these two unit vectors. It is the sum if the acute angle is to be bisected and the difference if the obtuse angle is to be bisected.

We suppose first that we need to find the plane bisecting the acute angle.

Adding the unit vectors gives $(3/7 + 4/13, -6/7 - 12/13, 2/7 + 3/13).$ That simplifies to $\left(\frac{61}{91}, \frac{-138}{91}, \frac{37}{91}\right)$. Multiplying these entries by 91 to clear the denominator, we get $(61, -138, 37)$ as the normal to the plane we're looking for.

Then, to find the constant term in the plane equation, we substitute the point $(-5,-1,-5)$ which the plane contains into the equation of the plane in normal form, which gives the equation of the plane as 

$61x - 138y + 37z - (-305 + 138 - 185) = 0.$  This simplifies to $\boxed{61x - 138y + 37z - 352 = 0}.$
If the plane that bisects the obtuse angle is desired, we use the difference of the unit normal vectors, which would proceed analogously.

Problem 18 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}

Reply: The given matrix is a projection matrix. The projection matrix onto one plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is of the form $I - 2uu^T$, where $I$ is the $3\times 3$ identity matrix, and $u$ is a unit normal vector to the plane normalized so that its first non-zero coordinate is positive.

So we need to equate the given matrix with $I - 2uu^T$, which gives us:

\[\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{13}{14} & -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{3}{14} \\ -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{5}{7} & \frac{3}{7} \\ \frac{3}{14} & \frac{3}{7} & \frac{5}{14} \end{pmatrix} = I - 2\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix}u_1^2 & u_1u_2 & u_1u_3 \\ u_1u_2 & u_2^2 & u_2u_3 \\ u_1u_3 & u_2u_3 & u_3^2\end{pmatrix},\] where $u=\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix}u_1 \\u_2 \\u_3\end{pmatrix}$.

Equating the respective elements in both matrices gives us:

==> From the first column, 
$$\frac{13}{14} = 1 - 2u_1^2, \quad -\frac{1}{7} = -2u_1u_2, \quad \frac{3}{14} = -2u_1u_3.$$

==> From the second column, 
$$-\frac{1}{7} = -2u_1u_2, \quad \frac{5}{7} = 1 - 2u_2^2, \quad \frac{3}{7} = -2u_2u_3.$$

==> From the third column,
$$\frac{3}{14} = -2u_1u_3, \quad \frac{3}{7} = -2u_2u_3, \quad \frac{5}{14} = 1-2u_3^2.$$

Solving these equations for $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$, we get 
$$u_1 = -\frac{1}{2}, \quad u_2 = -1, \quad u_3 = -\frac{3}{2}.$$

Since we need the normal vector with first nonzero entry positive,
we multiply $u$ by -1 to get

$$\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix}1 \\2 \\3\end{pmatrix}.$$ This is the unit normal vector to the plane. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix}1 \\2 \\3\end{pmatrix}}.$

Check: the answer in the reply is: $\begin{pmatrix}1 \\2 \\3\end{pmatrix}$.

comparing the answer with the ground truth answer \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}, it's clear the two are not the same. 

thus, the answer is incorrect. correct answer: $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$ | answer extracted: $\begin{pmatrix}1 \\2 \\3\end{pmatrix}$.

Problem 19 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 120^\circ

Reply: By the Angle Bisector Theorem,
\[\frac{AC}{CD} = \frac{AB}{BD}, \quad \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{AC}{CE}, \quad \frac{BC}{CE} = \frac{BA}{EA},\]
so $CD = CE,$ which means $\triangle CDE$ is isosceles.  Therefore, $\angle DEF = \angle BAC.$

Since $\angle DEF + \angle BAC + \angle CBA + \angle ACB = 180^\circ,$
\[\angle BAC + 90^\circ + \frac{\angle BAC}{2} + \frac{\angle BAC}{2} = 180^\circ.\]
Solving, we find $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$ and $\angle BAC = 120^\circ.$  Since $\angle BAC < 180^\circ,$ we exclude 120 degrees.

Therefore, the only possible value for $\angle BAC$ is $\boxed{60^\circ}$.
