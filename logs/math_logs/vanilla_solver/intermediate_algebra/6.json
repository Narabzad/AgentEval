  "response_with_ans": "The expression $x^2 + y^2$ equals $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2xy = (x+y)^2 - 2xy = 4 - 2xy$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Therefore, it is enough to compute $2xy = 2x(2-x)$ for all solutions $x$. \n\nNotice from the equation $x^5+(2-x)^5=82$ that if $x$ is a solution, then so is $2-x$. It follows that the solutions to $x^5+(2-x)^5=82$ come in pairs $\\{x,2-x\\}$, and each pair contributes $2x(2-x)+2(2-x)x = 4$ to the desired sum. The number of such pairs is equal to the number of real solutions to $x^5+(2-x)^5=82$, which is at most $5 + 5 = 10$ by Descartes' Rule of Signs. As equality holds (see below), the desired sum equals $4 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{40}$.\n\nEquality holds for Descartes' Rule of Signs because $x^5+(2-x)^5$ has ten roots in the complex plane:\n\nLet $u=x-1$, so $x=u+1$ and $x^5+(2-x)^5=82 \\Rightarrow (u+1)^5+(1-u)^5=82$, or $32u^5 = 82-2(1+5u+10u^2+10u^3+5u^4)$, or $u^5+5u^4/16+5u^3/8+5u^2/16+u/16-5/16=0$. By the Rational Root Theorem, the left-hand side, being a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, has a rational root if and only if it is $\\pm 1$ or $\\pm 5$. Checking these values, we find that $u=1$ is a root, so $x=2$ is a root of the original equation. Performing polynomial division (which is convenient to do by setting $5u^4+5u^2=16v$ and $5u^3+u=16w$ so that the quotient will have leading coefficient $16$), we find that the remaining quartic factor, $32u^4 - 15u^2 - 10$, factors as $(4u^2 - 2 - \\sqrt{7})^2$, hence has double roots at $u=\\pm(\\sqrt{2\\pm\\sqrt{7}})/2$. Therefore, those four roots and the double root $u=1$, together with their reflections in the line $u=1$ (i.e., $x=2$), yield all ten complex roots of the original polynomial.",
