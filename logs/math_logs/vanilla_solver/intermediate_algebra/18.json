  "response_with_ans": "Let's denote the degree 4 polynomial as \\(P(x) = ax^4 + bx^2 + c\\).\n\nNote that the power of \\(x\\) in \\(P(x)\\) must be even since we have \\(P(x) = P(-x)\\). Therefore, even if \\(P(x)\\) is of degree 4, terms as \\(x\\) and \\(x^3\\) cannot be present there. We confirm that we have \\(P(x) = ax^4 + bx^2 + c\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) can be any real number.\n\nNow, we express the equality \\(P(x^2) = P(x) P(-x)\\) using the definition of \\(P(x)\\):\n\n\\((ax^4 + bx^2 + c) = (ax^4 + bx^2 + c)^2 \\Rightarrow ax^4 + bx^2 + c = a^2x^8 + 2abx^6 + (2ac + b^2)x^4 + 2bcx^2 + c^2.\\)\n\nMatching coefficients, we obtain the following system of equations: \n\n1) \\(a = a^2\\)\n2) \\(b = 2ab + 2bc\\)\n3) \\(c = a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\)\n\nThe first equation has solutions \\(a = 0\\) and \\(a = 1\\).\n\nIf \\(a = 0\\), we get from the second equation that \\(b = 2bc\\). Then \\(b = 0\\) or \\(c = 1\\). Then \\(c = b^2 + c^2\\), and hence \\(c = 0\\) or \\(c = 1\\). So, if \\(a = 0\\) we have two solutions: \\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0)\\) and \\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 1)\\).\n\nIf \\(a = 1\\), we find from the second equation that \\(2b = 2 + 2c\\). Hence, \\(b = 1 + c\\). Then \\(c = 1 + (1 + c)^2 + c^2\\), so \\(c^2 + (2c - 1)^2 = 1\\). Solving this for \\(c\\), we get \\(c = 0\\) or \\(c = 1\\). Substituting these values into \\(b = 1 + c\\), we obtain that if \\(a = 1\\) we have two solutions again: \\((a, b, c) = (1, 1, 0)\\) and \\((a, b, c) = (1, 2, 1)\\).\n\nSo, we get a total of four solutions: \\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0);\\ (0, 0, 1);\\ (1, 1, 0);\\ (1, 2, 1)\\). Thus, there are 4 polynomials of degree 4 that satisfy the given equation.",
