  "response_with_ans": "First, let's denote the coordinates of the point $P$ as $(x,y)$.\n\nThe coordinate of the point $Q$ is $(\\frac{16}{5}, y)$, because it has the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and lies on the line $x = \\frac{16}{5}$.\n\nHence, the distances $PF$ and $PQ$ are given by:\n\n$PF = \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + y^2}$, and\n\n$PQ = \\sqrt{(x-\\frac{16}{5})^2}$\n\nAccording to the given condition, the ratio $\\frac{PF}{PQ} = \\frac{5}{4}$, so, let's put these values into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + y^2}}{\\sqrt{(x-\\frac{16}{5})^2}} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\nBy squaring both sides to get rid of the square roots, we get:\n\n$(x-5)^2 + y^2 = (\\frac{5}{4})^2 * (x- \\frac{16}{5})^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 = \\frac{25}{16}x^2 -20x + 25$ \n\nTo rewrite in standard form, we group the same terms and move them to one side:\n\n$\\frac{9}{16}x^2 + y^2 -10x = 0$\n\nRewriting this into a more common form of the ellipse equation we get:\n\n$(\\frac{16}{3})^2(x-\\frac{20}{9})^2 + y^2 = (\\frac{20}{3})^2$\n\nThus, the equation of the given curve is:\n\n$(\\frac{16}{3})^2(x-\\frac{20}{9})^2 + y^2 = (\\frac{20}{3})^2$",
