  "response_with_ans": "To find the minimum value of $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$, we need to do it step by step. \n\nFirst, simplify the expression by applying the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean of those numbers. In mathematical form, it says:\n\nIf $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$, then $\\frac{x + y}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{xy}$.\n\nHere we use $x=a^2$ and $y=b^2$, and therefore,\n$\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{a^2 b^2} = |ab| = 8$.\n\nThis gives us $a^2 + b^2 \\geq 16$.\n\nFrom the given condition, we have $a > b$ and $ab = 8$. Therefore, $a - b > 0$.  \n\nSubstituting this information into our given expression, we get $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b} \\geq \\frac{16}{a - b}$.\n\nNow, we need to minimize $\\frac{16}{a - b}$ knowing that $a - b > 0$. \n\nConsidering $a - b$ as a single variable, say $z$, with $z > 0$, the fraction $\\frac{16}{z}$ will be minimized when $z$ is maximized. \nSo to minimize $\\frac{16}{a - b}$ we need to maximize $a - b$ under given constraint $ab = 8$.\n\nBy AM-GM inequality, since $a, b > 0$, \n$\\frac{a + b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{8}$.\n\nThis gives us $a + b \\geq 2\\sqrt{8}$.\n\nSince $a + b \\geq 2\\sqrt{8}$, and recalling that $a - b$ is also a positive number, we realize that $a - b$ must be less than or equal to $a + b$. Hence, $a - b \\leq 2\\sqrt{8}$.\n\nSo, the maximum value of $a - b$ is $2\\sqrt{8}$. Substituting this back into our inequality, we find that the minimum possible value of $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ is $\\frac{16}{2\\sqrt{8}}$ which simplifies to $\\sqrt{8}$.",
