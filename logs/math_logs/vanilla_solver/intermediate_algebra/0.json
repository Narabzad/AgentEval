  "solution": "Let\n\\[g(n) = a + nb + \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} c + n^2 d + 2^{n - 1} e + n! \\cdot f.\\]It can be shown that\n\\[p(n) - 3p(n - 1) + 3p(n - 2) - p(n - 3) = 0\\]for any polynomial $p(n)$ of degree at most 2.  Thus, when we compute\n\\[g(n) - 3g(n - 1) + 3g(n - 2) - g(n - 3),\\]since the coefficients of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are all polynomials in $n$ of degree at most 2, all the terms of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ will cancel.  Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\ng(4) - 3g(3) + 3g(2) - g(1) &= 0 = e + 11f, \\\\\ng(5) - 3g(4) + 3g(3) - g(2) &= 42 = 2e + 64f, \\\\\ng(6) - 3g(5) + 3g(4) - g(3) &= g(6) - 126 = 4e + 426f.\n\\end{align*}Solving, we find $e = -11$ and $f = 1.$  Then $g(6) = 4e + 426f + 126 = \\boxed{508}.$",

  "response_with_ans": "To compute $a + 6b + 21c + 36d + 32e + 720f$, we can take a weighted combination of the given equations, such that the coefficients of each variable in the resulting equation match the desired coefficients.\n\nTo achieve this, let's multiply the first equation by 6, the second equation by 5, the third by 2, the fourth by 1 and then subtract the fifth equation. The result is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&6a + 6b + 6c + 6d + 6e + 6f \\\\\n&\\quad + 5a + 10b + 15c + 20d + 10e + 10f \\\\\n&\\quad + 2a + 6b + 12c + 18d + 8e+ 12f \\\\\n&\\quad + a + 4b + 10c + 16d + 8e + 24f \\\\\n&\\quad - a - 5b - 15c -25d - 16e - 120f \\\\\n&= 14a + 21b + 26c + 35d + 8e + 30f = 42 - 14*0 = 14*3 = 14 * 42/14 = 42.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThis operation matches the coefficients for $b, d,$ and $f$. However, we still need to correct the coefficients for $a, c,$ and $e$ appropriately.\n\nGoing back to the result, observe carefully, the coefficients of $b$ and $d$ are already as we want, and the coefficient of $a$ is 14 which can be reduced to 1 by dividing the whole equation by 14:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{21b + 26c + 35d + 8e + 30f}{14} = \\frac{42}{14} = 3\n\\]\n\nAlso looking at the original equations, we see that the first equation is:\n\n\\[\na + b + c + d + e + f = 0\n\\]\n\nIf we subtract this equation twice from the above equation, we can get rid of the $b$ and $d$ terms in the second equation without the desired coefficients:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{19c + 6e + 28f}{14} - 2b - 2c - 2d - 2e - 2f = 3 - 2*0 \n\\]\n\nSolving this we get the equation:\n\n\\[\na + 6b + 21c + 36d + 32e + 720f = 3\n\\] \n\nHence, $a + 6b + 21c + 36d + 32e + 720f = 3$.",
