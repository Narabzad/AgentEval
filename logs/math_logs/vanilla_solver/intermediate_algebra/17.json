  "solution": "We can write the function as\n\\[f(x) = \\sqrt{(7 - x)(3 + x)} - \\sqrt{(5 - x)(2 + x)}.\\]This shows that the function is defined only for $-2 \\le x \\le 5.$  Also, $(7 - x)(3 + x) - (5 - x)(2 + x) = x + 11 > 0$ on this interval, which means that $f(x)$ is always positive.\n\nThen\n\\begin{align*}\n[f(x)]^2 &= (7 - x)(3 + x) - 2 \\sqrt{(7 - x)(3 + x)} \\sqrt{(5 - x)(2 + x)} + (5 - x)(2 + x) \\\\\n&= -2x^2 + 7x + 31 - 2 \\sqrt{(7 - x)(2 + x)(5 - x)(3 + x)} \\\\\n&= 2 + (7 - x)(2 + x) - 2 \\sqrt{(7 - x)(2 + x)} \\sqrt{(5 - x)(3 + x)} + (5 - x)(3 + x) \\\\\n&= 2 + \\left[ \\sqrt{(7 - x)(2 + x)} - \\sqrt{(5 - x)(3 + x)} \\right]^2 \\ge 2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $f(x) \\ge \\sqrt{2}.$\n\nEquality occurs when $(7 - x)(2 + x) = (5 - x)(3 + x),$ or $x = \\frac{1}{3}.$  We conclude that the minimum value is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$",

  "response_with_ans": "By completing the square, we rewrite the expressions inside the square roots as follows:\n\n\\[-x^2 + 4x + 21 = -(x - 2)^2 + 25\\]\n\\[-x^2 + 3x + 10 = -(x - 1.5)^2 + 11.25\\]\n\nTherefore, the function \\(f(x)\\) becomes:\n\n\\[f(x) = \\sqrt{-(x - 2)^2 + 25} - \\sqrt{-(x - 1.5)^2 + 11.25}.\\]\n\nThe quantities inside the square roots are maximized when \\(x - 2 = 0\\) and \\(x - 1.5 = 0\\), respectively, which means \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 1.5\\). Both maxima cannot be achieved simultaneously, given that the maxima locations are different.\n\nSo taking the minimum of the two values for \\(x\\), we substitute \\(x = 1.5\\) into the equation to obtain:\n\n\\[f(1.5) = \\sqrt{-(1.5 - 2)^2 + 25} - \\sqrt{-(1.5 - 1.5)^2 + 11.25} = \\sqrt{24.75} - \\sqrt{11.25}.\\]\n\nCalculating the above expression approximately gives us:\n\n\\[f(1.5) = 4.98 - 3.35 = 1.63.\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function is approximately 1.63.",
