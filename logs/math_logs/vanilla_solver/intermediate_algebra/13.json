  "solution": "Let $r$ be the common root, so\n\\begin{align*}\nr^2 - ar + 24 &= 0, \\\\\nr^2 - br + 36 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these equations, we get $(a - b) r + 12 = 0,$ so $r = \\frac{12}{b - a}.$  Substituting into $x^2 - ax + 24 = 0,$ we get\n\\[\\frac{144}{(b - a)^2} - a \\cdot \\frac{12}{b - a} + 24 = 0.\\]Then\n\\[144 - 12a(b - a) + 24(b - a)^2 = 0,\\]so $12 - a(b - a) + 2(b - a)^2 = 0.$  Then\n\\[a(b - a) - 2(b - a)^2 = 12,\\]which factors as $(b - a)(3a - 2b) = 12.$\n\nLet $n = b - a,$ which must be a factor of 12.  Then $3a - 2b = \\frac{12}{n}.$  Solving for $a$ and $b,$ we find\n\\[a = 2n + \\frac{12}{n}, \\quad b = 3n + \\frac{12}{n}.\\]Since $n$ is a factor of 12, $\\frac{12}{n}$ is also an integer, which means $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n\nThus, we can take $n$ as any of the 12 divisors of 12 (including positive and negative divisors), leading to $\\boxed{12}$ pairs $(a,b).$",

  "response_with_ans": "First, we need to note that the discriminants of the polynomials must be non-negative because the roots are real. The discriminants are $a^2 - 4*24$ and $b^2 - 4*36$. So we have $a^2 \\geq 96$ and $b^2 \\geq 144$. From these conditions, we deduce that $|a|$ is between 10 to 100 and $|b|$ is between 12 to 100. \n\nIf the polynomials share a common root, by Vieta's formulas the sum of the roots are equal. For the first polynomial, the sum is $a$, for the second it's $b$. Thus, $a = b$.\n\nThe possible values for $(a, b)$ in the range $[-100, 100]$ are $ |a, b| = [12 \\leq a, b \\leq 100] $, so there are 89 potential pairs in the positive range, and the same in the negative range, plus the pair $(0, 0)$.\n\nSo, the number of pairs of integers $(a, b)$ is $2*89 + 1 = 179$.",
