  "problem": "The members of a distinguished committee were choosing a president, and each member gave one vote to one of the 27 candidates.  For each candidate, the exact percentage of votes the candidate got was smaller by at least 1 than the number of votes for that candidate. What is the smallest possible number of members of the committee?",

  "solution": "Let $t$ be the number of members of the committee, $n_k$ be the number of votes for candidate $k$, and let $p_k$ be the percentage of votes for candidate $k$ for $k= 1,2, \\dots, 27$. We have $$n_k \\ge p_k+1 = {{100n_k}\\over t} +1.$$Adding these 27 inequalities yields $t \\ge 127$.\n\nSolving for $n_k$ gives $n_k \\ge \\displaystyle{t \\over{t-100}}$, and, since $n_k$ is an integer, we obtain $$n_k \\ge \\biggl\\lceil{t \\over{t-100}}\\biggr\\rceil,$$where the notation $\\lceil x\\rceil$ denotes the least integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. The last inequality is satisfied for all $k= 1,2, \\dots, 27$ if and only if it is satisfied by the smallest $n_k$, say $n_1$. Since $t \\ge 27n_1$, we obtain $$t \\ge 27 \\biggl\\lceil{t \\over {t-100}} \\bigg\\rceil \\quad (1)$$and our problem reduces to finding the smallest possible integer $t\\ge127$ that satisfies the inequality (1).\n\nIf ${t \\over {t-100}} > 4$, that is, $t \\le 133$, then $27\\left\\lceil{t\\over {t-100}}\\right\\rceil \\ge27 \\cdot5=135$ so that the inequality (1) is not satisfied. Thus $\\boxed{134}$ is the least possible number of members in the committee.  Note that when $t=134$, an election in which 1 candidate receives 30 votes and the remaining 26 candidates receive 4 votes each satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\n$\\centerline{{\\bf OR}}$\n\nLet $t$ be the number of members of the committee, and let $m$ be the least number of votes that any candidate received.  It is clear that $m \\ne 0$ and $m \\ne 1$.  If $m=2$, then $2 \\ge 1+100 \\cdot \\frac{2}{t}$, so $t \\ge 200$.  Similarly, if $m=3$, then $3 \\ge 1+100 \\cdot \\frac{3}{t}$, and $t \\ge 150$; and if $m=4$, then $4 \\ge 1+100 \\cdot \\frac{4}{t}$, so $t \\ge 134$. When $m \\ge 5$, $t \\ge 27 \\cdot\n5=135$.  Thus $t \\ge 134$. Verify that $t$ can be $\\boxed{134}$ by noting that the votes may be distributed so that 1 candidate receives 30 votes and the remaining 26 candidates receive 4 votes each.",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's mathematically model that problem. Let's denote the number of votes for each candidate as v_i and the total number of votes as V. What's given is that v_i/V * 100 < v_i - 1 for each candidate. Solve it for V and we get V > 100 * v_i / (v_i - 1).\n\nThe smallest possible number of votes v_i that candidate can receive is 1 (since the candidate must receive at least one vote), so we substitute it into the expression and we get V > 100.\n\nHowever, because each candidate must receive at least one vote and there are 27 candidates, the smallest number of votes necessary is actually 27. The percentage of votes that would correspond to each candidate receiving one vote is approximately 3.7%, which is less than all but one of the candidates. Thus, the number of committee members must be greater than 100.\n\nThe smallest number greater than 100 that is divisible by 27 (since each member gives one vote to one of the 27 candidates) is 108. Therefore, the smallest possible number of members of the committee is 108.",
