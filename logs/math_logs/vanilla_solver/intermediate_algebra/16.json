  "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
  "solution": "Maximizing $\\frac{x + y}{x - y}$ is equivalent to maximizing\n\\[\\frac{x + y}{x - y} + 1 = \\frac{2x}{x - y} = \\frac{-2x}{y - x}.\\]Note that $-2x$ and $y - x$ are always positive, so to maximize this expression, we take $y = 2,$ the smallest possible value of $y.$\n\nThen maximizing $\\frac{x + 2}{x - 2}$ is equivalent to maximizing\n\\[\\frac{x + 2}{x - 2} - 1 = \\frac{4}{x - 2} = -\\frac{4}{2 - x}.\\]Note that $2 - x$ is always positive, so to maximize this expression, we take $x = -5.$  Hence, the maximum value is $\\frac{-5 + 2}{-5 - 2} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}.$",

  "response_with_ans": "The given quantities are x \u2208 [-5,-3] and y \u2208 [2,4]. \n\nThe expression $\\frac{x+y}{x-y}$ will maximize when the numerator (x+y) is maximized, and the denominator (x-y) is minimized simultaneously based on simple optimization. \n\nThe numerator (x+y) will be maximized when x is maximized and y too is maximized, i.e., x = -3 and y = 4. So, the maximum value of the numerator is (-3)+4 = 1.\n\nThe denominator (x-y) will be minimized when x is minimized and y is maximized, i.e., x = -5 and y = 4. So, the minimum value of the denominator is -5-4 = -9.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $\\frac{x+y}{x-y}$ is $\\frac{1}{-9}$ which equals -0.111.",
