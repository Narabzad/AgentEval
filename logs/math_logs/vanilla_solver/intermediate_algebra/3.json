  "solution": "Each of the $x^2$-terms in the expansion of the product is obtained by multiplying the $x$-terms from two of the 15 factors of the product.  The coefficient of the $x^2$-term is therefore the sum of the products of each pair of numbers in the set $\\{-1,2,-3,\\ldots,14,-15\\}$. Note that, in general, $$(a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n)^2=a_1^2+a_2^2+\\cdots+a_n^2+2\\cdot\\left(\\sum_{1\\le\ni<j\\le n}a_ia_j\\right).$$Thus, the coefficient of $x^2$ is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{1\\le i<j\\le15}(-1)^{i}i(-1)^{j}j&=\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\sum^{15}_{k=1}(-1)^{k}k\\right)^2-\n\\sum^{15}_{k=1}k^2\\right)\\cr\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((-8)^2-\\frac{15(15+1)(2\\cdot15+1)}{6}\\right)=-588.\\cr\n\\end{align*}$$\\centerline{\\bf {OR}}$$Let $C$ be the coefficient of $x^2.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=(1-x)(1+2x)(1-3x)\\dotsm(1-15x)\\cr\n&=1+(-1+2-3+\\cdots-15)x+Cx^2+\\cdots\\cr &=1-8x+Cx^2+\\cdots.\\cr\n\\end{align*}Thus $f(-x)=1+8x+Cx^2-\\cdots\\,$. But $f(-x)=(1+x)(1-2x)(1+3x)\\ldots(1+15x)$, so  \\begin{align*}\nf(x)f(-x)&=\n(1-x^2)(1-4x^2)(1-9x^2)\\dotsm(1-225x^2)\\cr&=\n1-(1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots+15^2)x^2+\\cdots.\n\\end{align*}Also $f(x)f(-x)=\n(1-8x+Cx^2+\\cdots)(1+8x+Cx^2-\\cdots)=1+(2C-64)x^2+\\cdots\\,$. Thus $2C-64=-(1^2+2^2+3^3+\\cdots+15^2)$, and, as above, $C=\\boxed{-588}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's note that for the coefficient of $x^2$ to come, it has to originate from the products of the $x$ terms from two factors and the constants from the other factors.\n\nSo, we can get the coefficient of $x^2$ by choosing two of the $15$ brackets to get the $x$ from and picking the constants from the other $13$ brackets.\n\nFor instance, if we took a pair of brackets like $(1-x)(1+2x)$, we would get $-2x^2$ as the coefficient of $x^2$.\n\nTaking a pair of brackets, $(1+2x)(1-3x)$, we would get $-6x^2$.\n\nFor any bracket pair $(1- ax)(1 + bx)$, we get $-abx^2$.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient of $x^2$ is the sum of all possible two-bracket combinations, each multiplied by $-1$, as the term is negative.\n\nWe can express the total coefficient C as:\n\n$C = -1 \\times [ \\sum_{1 \\le n < m \\le 15} nm]$ \n\nIn the above expression, we are summing the product of all pairs $(n,m)$ such that $1 \\le n < m \\le 15$.\n\nThis is equal to $-1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} [(1+2+...+15)^2 - (1^2+2^2+...+15^2)]$, using the fact that $(1+2+...+n)^2 = 1^2+2^2+...+n^2 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le n < m \\le n} nm$.\n\nNow, using the formulas for the sum of first n natural numbers ($\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$) and the sum of squares of first n natural numbers ($\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$), we substitute $n=15$ and get:\n\n$C = -1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} [\\left(\\frac{15(15+1)}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{15(15+1)(2*15+1)}{6}] = -560$.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion is $-560$.\n",
