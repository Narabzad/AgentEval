Problem 0 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 508

Reply: To compute $a + 6b + 21c + 36d + 32e + 720f$, we can take a weighted combination of the given equations, such that the coefficients of each variable in the resulting equation match the desired coefficients.

To achieve this, let's multiply the first equation by 6, the second equation by 5, the third by 2, the fourth by 1 and then subtract the fifth equation. The result is:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&6a + 6b + 6c + 6d + 6e + 6f \\
&\quad + 5a + 10b + 15c + 20d + 10e + 10f \\
&\quad + 2a + 6b + 12c + 18d + 8e+ 12f \\
&\quad + a + 4b + 10c + 16d + 8e + 24f \\
&\quad - a - 5b - 15c -25d - 16e - 120f \\
&= 14a + 21b + 26c + 35d + 8e + 30f = 42 - 14*0 = 14*3 = 14 * 42/14 = 42.
\end{aligned}
\]

This operation matches the coefficients for $b, d,$ and $f$. However, we still need to correct the coefficients for $a, c,$ and $e$ appropriately.

Going back to the result, observe carefully, the coefficients of $b$ and $d$ are already as we want, and the coefficient of $a$ is 14 which can be reduced to 1 by dividing the whole equation by 14:

\[
a + \frac{21b + 26c + 35d + 8e + 30f}{14} = \frac{42}{14} = 3
\]

Also looking at the original equations, we see that the first equation is:

\[
a + b + c + d + e + f = 0
\]

If we subtract this equation twice from the above equation, we can get rid of the $b$ and $d$ terms in the second equation without the desired coefficients:

\[
a + \frac{19c + 6e + 28f}{14} - 2b - 2c - 2d - 2e - 2f = 3 - 2*0 
\]

Solving this we get the equation:

\[
a + 6b + 21c + 36d + 32e + 720f = 3
\] 

Hence, $a + 6b + 21c + 36d + 32e + 720f = 3$.

Problem 1 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 4036

Reply: From the condition, we have
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\cdot\frac{k^2}{n^2}&=1 \\
\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\cdot\frac{(k+1)^2}{(n+1)^2}&=1 \\
\end{align*}
Subtracting these equations gives
\[\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\left(\frac{k^2}{n^2}-\frac{(k+1)^2}{(n+1)^2}\right)=0\]
which simplifies to
\[\frac{2n+1}{n(n+1)^2}\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\cdot k=0.\]
But for $n \geq 2,$
\[\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\cdot k\geq a_n\cdot\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\]
by the AM--GM inequality. Therefore
\[a_n\leq\frac{-2n(n+1)}{(2n+1)(n+1)}=-\frac{2}{2n+1}\].
Substituting $n=1009$ yields
\[a_{1009}\leq-\frac{1}{1009}<\frac{1}{2018},\]
but for $1\leq n\leq1008,$
\[a_n>\frac{-2}{2n+1}\geq-\frac{1}{1007}>\frac{1}{2018},\]
so $\boxed{1009}$ is indeed the smallest such $n.$

Problem 2 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \left[ -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right]

Reply: Let $c = x + y$ and $d = 1 - xy.$  Then we can write
\[\frac{(x + y)(1 - xy)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)} = \frac{cd}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}.\]To determine the range of $c,$ note that $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, so the smallest possible value of $c = x + y$ is $-\infty$, and the largest possible value is $\infty$, so $c$ can be any real number.

To determine the range of $d = 1 - xy,$ note that $d$ is at a minimum when $xy$ is at a maximum.  As $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, we cannot bound $xy$.  Therefore, $d$ can take on the value $-\infty$.

On the other hand, $d$ is at a maximum when $xy$ is at a minimum, i.e. $xy = -\infty$.  But this is not possible because both $x$ and $y$ are limited to real numbers, so the maximum value of $xy$ is $\infty$.  Therefore, $d$ is at a maximum when $xy = -\infty.$  So the range of $d$ is $[-\infty, 1].$

Note that the denominator $(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2) \geq 0$, so the quotient $\frac{cd}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}$ takes on all real values, except possibly 0. If $cd = 0$, then either $c = 0$ or $d = 0$, or both.

If $c = 0$, then $x + y = 0$. We can take $x = 1$ and $y = -1$. Then $(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2) = 2$ and $cd = 0$, so 0 is in the range of $\frac{cd}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}$.

If $d = 0$, then $1 = xy$. Choose $x = y = 1$. Then $c = x + y = 2$, $(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2) = 4$, and $cd = 0$, so 0 is in the range of $\frac{cd}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}$.

Hence, the set of possible values of $\frac{(x + y)(1 - xy)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}$ is $\boxed{(-\infty,\infty)}$, i.e., all real numbers.

Problem 3 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: -588

Reply: Let's note that for the coefficient of $x^2$ to come, it has to originate from the products of the $x$ terms from two factors and the constants from the other factors.

So, we can get the coefficient of $x^2$ by choosing two of the $15$ brackets to get the $x$ from and picking the constants from the other $13$ brackets.

For instance, if we took a pair of brackets like $(1-x)(1+2x)$, we would get $-2x^2$ as the coefficient of $x^2$.

Taking a pair of brackets, $(1+2x)(1-3x)$, we would get $-6x^2$.

For any bracket pair $(1- ax)(1 + bx)$, we get $-abx^2$.

Therefore, the total coefficient of $x^2$ is the sum of all possible two-bracket combinations, each multiplied by $-1$, as the term is negative.

We can express the total coefficient C as:

$C = -1 \times [ \sum_{1 \le n < m \le 15} nm]$ 

In the above expression, we are summing the product of all pairs $(n,m)$ such that $1 \le n < m \le 15$.

This is equal to $-1 \times \frac{1}{2} [(1+2+...+15)^2 - (1^2+2^2+...+15^2)]$, using the fact that $(1+2+...+n)^2 = 1^2+2^2+...+n^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \le n < m \le n} nm$.

Now, using the formulas for the sum of first n natural numbers ($\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$) and the sum of squares of first n natural numbers ($\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$), we substitute $n=15$ and get:

$C = -1 \times \frac{1}{2} [\left(\frac{15(15+1)}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{15(15+1)(2*15+1)}{6}] = -560$.

Therefore, the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion is $-560$.

Problem 4 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 8

Reply: To find the minimum value of $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$, we need to do it step by step. 

First, simplify the expression by applying the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean of those numbers. In mathematical form, it says:

If $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$, then $\frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}$.

Here we use $x=a^2$ and $y=b^2$, and therefore,
$\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{a^2 b^2} = |ab| = 8$.

This gives us $a^2 + b^2 \geq 16$.

From the given condition, we have $a > b$ and $ab = 8$. Therefore, $a - b > 0$.  

Substituting this information into our given expression, we get $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b} \geq \frac{16}{a - b}$.

Now, we need to minimize $\frac{16}{a - b}$ knowing that $a - b > 0$. 

Considering $a - b$ as a single variable, say $z$, with $z > 0$, the fraction $\frac{16}{z}$ will be minimized when $z$ is maximized. 
So to minimize $\frac{16}{a - b}$ we need to maximize $a - b$ under given constraint $ab = 8$.

By AM-GM inequality, since $a, b > 0$, 
$\frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{8}$.

This gives us $a + b \geq 2\sqrt{8}$.

Since $a + b \geq 2\sqrt{8}$, and recalling that $a - b$ is also a positive number, we realize that $a - b$ must be less than or equal to $a + b$. Hence, $a - b \leq 2\sqrt{8}$.

So, the maximum value of $a - b$ is $2\sqrt{8}$. Substituting this back into our inequality, we find that the minimum possible value of $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ is $\frac{16}{2\sqrt{8}}$ which simplifies to $\sqrt{8}$.

Problem 5 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{x^2}{16} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1

Reply: First, let's denote the coordinates of the point $P$ as $(x,y)$.

The coordinate of the point $Q$ is $(\frac{16}{5}, y)$, because it has the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and lies on the line $x = \frac{16}{5}$.

Hence, the distances $PF$ and $PQ$ are given by:

$PF = \sqrt{(x-5)^2 + y^2}$, and

$PQ = \sqrt{(x-\frac{16}{5})^2}$

According to the given condition, the ratio $\frac{PF}{PQ} = \frac{5}{4}$, so, let's put these values into the equation:

$\frac{\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + y^2}}{\sqrt{(x-\frac{16}{5})^2}} = \frac{5}{4}$

By squaring both sides to get rid of the square roots, we get:

$(x-5)^2 + y^2 = (\frac{5}{4})^2 * (x- \frac{16}{5})^2$

This simplifies to:

$x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 = \frac{25}{16}x^2 -20x + 25$ 

To rewrite in standard form, we group the same terms and move them to one side:

$\frac{9}{16}x^2 + y^2 -10x = 0$

Rewriting this into a more common form of the ellipse equation we get:

$(\frac{16}{3})^2(x-\frac{20}{9})^2 + y^2 = (\frac{20}{3})^2$

Thus, the equation of the given curve is:

$(\frac{16}{3})^2(x-\frac{20}{9})^2 + y^2 = (\frac{20}{3})^2$
%%%%%%%
Check: the answer extracted is: $(\frac{16}{3})^2(x-\frac{20}{9})^2 + y^2 = (\frac{20}{3})^2$.

comparatively, the ground truth answer is: $\frac{x^2}{16} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$.

by just visual comparison, the two equations do not seem to match. additionally, the problem is requesting it in standard form and even if the equation the reply provided could be converted into the ground truth answer, it is not currently in the correct format.

therefore, the answer is not correct. the reply's answer does not match the ground truth answer.

Problem 6 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 12

Reply: The expression $x^2 + y^2$ equals $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2xy = (x+y)^2 - 2xy = 4 - 2xy$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Therefore, it is enough to compute $2xy = 2x(2-x)$ for all solutions $x$. 

Notice from the equation $x^5+(2-x)^5=82$ that if $x$ is a solution, then so is $2-x$. It follows that the solutions to $x^5+(2-x)^5=82$ come in pairs $\{x,2-x\}$, and each pair contributes $2x(2-x)+2(2-x)x = 4$ to the desired sum. The number of such pairs is equal to the number of real solutions to $x^5+(2-x)^5=82$, which is at most $5 + 5 = 10$ by Descartes' Rule of Signs. As equality holds (see below), the desired sum equals $4 \cdot 10 = \boxed{40}$.

Equality holds for Descartes' Rule of Signs because $x^5+(2-x)^5$ has ten roots in the complex plane:

Let $u=x-1$, so $x=u+1$ and $x^5+(2-x)^5=82 \Rightarrow (u+1)^5+(1-u)^5=82$, or $32u^5 = 82-2(1+5u+10u^2+10u^3+5u^4)$, or $u^5+5u^4/16+5u^3/8+5u^2/16+u/16-5/16=0$. By the Rational Root Theorem, the left-hand side, being a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, has a rational root if and only if it is $\pm 1$ or $\pm 5$. Checking these values, we find that $u=1$ is a root, so $x=2$ is a root of the original equation. Performing polynomial division (which is convenient to do by setting $5u^4+5u^2=16v$ and $5u^3+u=16w$ so that the quotient will have leading coefficient $16$), we find that the remaining quartic factor, $32u^4 - 15u^2 - 10$, factors as $(4u^2 - 2 - \sqrt{7})^2$, hence has double roots at $u=\pm(\sqrt{2\pm\sqrt{7}})/2$. Therefore, those four roots and the double root $u=1$, together with their reflections in the line $u=1$ (i.e., $x=2$), yield all ten complex roots of the original polynomial.

Problem 7 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 0

Reply: Let us denote $x = a+b$, $y = a+c$, $z = a+d$, $w = b+c$, $u = b+d$, $v = c+d$. We want to maximize $|xyzwuv|$ under the conditions $|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1$ and $a+b+c+d = 0$. Note that $xyzwuv = (\overline{a}^2+\overline{b}^2+\overline{c}^2+\overline{d}^2)(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2) - abc\overline{d} - abd\overline{c}-acd\overline{b}-bcd\overline{a}$. 

By considering the $a+b+c+d = 0$ condition, we have: 

\[\overline{a} = -\overline{b} -\overline{c} -\overline{d}\]

and

\[a = -b -c -d.\]

Substituting these equations in $xyzwuv$, we get

\[xyzwuv = 12 + 2(\overline{a}bc + \overline{b}cd + \overline{c}da + \overline{d}ab)\]

Now we know that the triangle inequality $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ is satisfied with equality if and only if $a$ and $b$ point in the same direction, in this case, $b$ to be a root of unity times $a$.

This allows us to conclude that $\overline{a}bc,\ \overline{b}cd,\ \overline{c}da,\ \overline{d}ab$ are all of the form $z\bar{z}$ = |z|^2 where z is a complex number. Hence, $xyzwuv$ is always real and we want to maximize it.

Using $z\bar{z}$ = |z|^2, we get

\[xyzwuv = 12 + 2(|abc| + |bcd| + |cda| + |dab|).\]

Then for the triangle inequality we know that |abc| ≤ |a|*|b|*|c| = 1, so

\[xyzwuv ≤ 20.\]

Now, let $a = e^{i0}$, $b = e^{i2\pi/3}$, $c = e^{i4\pi/3}$, $d = -1=e^{i\pi}$. It is not difficult to verify that $|a+b+c+d| = 0$ and $|xyzwuv| = 20$. Hence, the maximum value is $\boxed{020}$.

Reply: The constant term $a_0$ in the polynomial is the product of the roots, taken n at a time, given that the leading coefficient $a_n=2$. Since $a_0 = 66$ this means the roots have the possible pairs $(66,1)$, $(33,2)$, and $(22,3)$, since 66=66*1=33*2=22*3.

As the roots are distinct integers, the only possible pair we can use is $(22,3)$.

The absolute value of $a_{n-1}$ is equal to the sum of roots, taken one at a time, times the leading coefficient $a_n$. Therefore, $|a_{n-1}| = 2 \cdot (|-22| + |3|) = 2 \cdot 25 = 50$.

Reply: Rewrite the equation as $y=1-x$. Substituting into the equation gives $x^4(1-x)+x(1-x)^4$. Since we're looking for a maximum, we will take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. The derivative is obtained as follows:

\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} [x^4(1-x)+x(1-x)^4] &= 4x^3(1-x)-x^4+4x(1-x)^3-4x^2(1-x)^3 \\
&= 4x^3-4x^4+4x-4x^2-4x^2+4x^3 \\
&= 8x^3-8x^4+4x-8x^2 \\
&= 4x(2x^2-2x^3+1-2x) \\
&= 4x(2x^2(1-x)+1-2x),
\end{align*}

Setting this equal to zero yields $x=0$ or $2x^2(1-x)+1-2x=0$.

This cubic equation can be simplified to $2x^3-3x^2+1=0$. Now, let's find the roots of this equation. Applying Vieta's formulas gives us the roots $1$, $\frac{1}{2}$, and $-1$. Since $x$ must be a nonnegative real number and not bigger than 1, we can discard the root $-1$.

Plug in $x=0$, $x=\frac{1}{2}$, and $x=1$ into the equation we will be able to get the maximum of the given quantity. 

For $x=0$, $x^4y+xy^4=0$.

For $x=\frac{1}{2}$, $x^4y+xy^4=(\frac{1}{2})^4(\frac{1}{2})+(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})^4=\frac{1}{32}+\frac{1}{32}=\frac{1}{16}$.

For $x=1$, $x^4y+xy^4=1^4*0+0*1^4=0$.

Problem 10 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 9

Reply: In this problem, the symbol $\lfloor x \rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, which is known as the floor function. 

The definition of the floor function tells us that $n \leq \lfloor x \rfloor < n + 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and multiplying by a positive number changes this to $an \leq a\lfloor x \rfloor < a(n + 1)$. 

In this case, $a, b, c, d > 0$ are all positive, we can use the property of the floor function to write

\[\left\lfloor \frac{b + c + d}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + c + d}{b} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + b + d}{c} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a + b + c}{d} \right\rfloor\]
\[ \geq \frac{b + c + d}{a} + \frac{a + c + d}{b} + \frac{a + b + d}{c} + \frac{a + b + c}{d} - 4.\]

By the AM-HM Inequality, 

\[\frac{1}{4}\left( \frac{b + c + d}{a} + \frac{a + c + d}{b} + \frac{a + b + d}{c} + \frac{a + b + c}{d}\right) \geq \frac{4}{\frac{a}{b+c+d}+\frac{b}{a+c+d}+\frac{c}{a+b+d}+\frac{d}{a+b+c}}\]
\[\Rightarrow \frac{b + c + d}{a} + \frac{a + c + d}{b} + \frac{a + b + d}{c} + \frac{a + b + c}{d} \geq \frac{16}{\frac{a}{b+c+d}+\frac{b}{a+c+d}+\frac{c}{a+b+d}+\frac{d}{a+b+c}}\]
\[\geq 16\] 
where the last inequality is again by AM-HM on the terms $\frac{a}{b+c+d},$ $\frac{b}{a+c+d},$ $\frac{c}{a+b+d},$ $\frac{d}{a+b+c}.$

So, the minimum value of this expression is $16 - 4 = 12$ when $a = b = c = d$.

Problem 11 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{17}{21}

Reply: To apply the Triangle Inequality, one must have $a + b > c,$ $b + c > a,$ and $c + a > b.$  For a fixed value of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ must satisfy
\[1 \le b < a + c \le 2a\]
or
\[1 \le c < a + b \le 2a.\]
Then for a fixed value of $a,$ the value of $b$ or $c$ can be at most $2a - 1,$ so $(a,b,c) \in T$ if and only if $(a,b,a + 1),$ $(a,b,a + 2),$ $\dots,$ $(a,b,2a - 1)$ are in $T.$  Hence,
\[\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} = \sum_{a,b = 1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{5^{a + 1}} + \frac{1}{5^{a + 2}} + \dots + \frac{1}{5^{2a - 1}} \right) \frac{2^a}{3^b}.\]
Then
\[\frac{1}{5^{a + 1}} + \frac{1}{5^{a + 2}} + \dots + \frac{1}{5^{2a - 1}} = \frac{5^{2a - 1} + 5^{2a - 2} + \dots + 5^{a + 1}}{5^{2a - 1}} = \frac{5^{2a - 1} - 5^{a + 1}}{4 \cdot 5^{2a - 1}} = \frac{5^{a - 2} - 1}{4},\]
so
\[\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} = \sum_{a,b = 1}^{\infty} \frac{5^{a - 2} - 1}{4} \cdot \frac{2^a}{3^b} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{a,b = 1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} + \sum_{a,b = 1}^{\infty} \frac{2^{a + 3}}{3^b 5^a}.\]

\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{y^n} = \frac{x/y}{1 - x/y}\]

Problem 12 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 214

Reply: By AM-GM,
\[ac + bd \le \frac{(a + b)(c + d)}{4} = \frac{143}{4} = 35.75,\]
\[ac + bd \le \frac{(a + c)(b + d)}{4} = 37.5,\]
\[ac + bd \le \frac{(a + d)(b + c)}{4} = 42.25.\]
The maximum of these three values is 42.25, so $ac + bd \le 42.25.$

Similarly,
\[bc + ad \le 35.75,\]
\[bc + ad \le 42.25;\]
hence $bc + ad \le 42.25.$

Finally,
\[ab + cd \le 37.5,\]
\[ab + cd \le 42.25,\]
so $ab + cd \le 42.25.$

Thus, $\frac{1}{2}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)$ is an average of $ab + cd,$ $ac + bd,$ and $bc + ad,$ so $\frac{1}{2}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) \le \frac{143}{2},$ or
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \le 143.\]Equality occurs when $a : b = c : d = 5 : 6$ and $a = c$ and $b = d.$  Checking, we find the solutions $a = c = 5$ and $b = d = 6$ work, so the smallest possible value is $\boxed{143}$.

Problem 13 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 12

Reply: First, we need to note that the discriminants of the polynomials must be non-negative because the roots are real. The discriminants are $a^2 - 4*24$ and $b^2 - 4*36$. So we have $a^2 \geq 96$ and $b^2 \geq 144$. From these conditions, we deduce that $|a|$ is between 10 to 100 and $|b|$ is between 12 to 100. 

If the polynomials share a common root, by Vieta's formulas the sum of the roots are equal. For the first polynomial, the sum is $a$, for the second it's $b$. Thus, $a = b$.

The possible values for $(a, b)$ in the range $[-100, 100]$ are $ |a, b| = [12 \leq a, b \leq 100] $, so there are 89 potential pairs in the positive range, and the same in the negative range, plus the pair $(0, 0)$.

So, the number of pairs of integers $(a, b)$ is $2*89 + 1 = 179$.

Problem 14 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: -50

Reply: First, notice that each $r_n$ is a root of the equation $x^{98} + x^{97} + x^{96} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1 = 0.$ We will rearrange this polynomial by combining like terms:

\begin{align*}
x^{98} + x^{97} + x^{96} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1 &= 0 \\
x (x^{97} + x^{96} + x^{95} + \dots + x^1 + 1) + 1 &= 0 \\
x (x^{97} + x^{96} + x^{95} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1) - x + 1 &= 0
\end{align*}

The calculation then becomes $x(xP(x) - 1) + 1 = 0$, where $P(x) = x^{97} + x^{96} + x^{95} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1$.

Now, let's evaluate the given expression by substituting $r_n$ into this derived equation for each term in the sum:

\[\frac{r_n^2}{r_n + 1} = r_n - \frac{r_n}{r_n + 1} = r_n - \frac{1}{r_n P(r_n) - 1}.\]

By using the polynomial equation we derived, we know that $r_n P(r_n) = 1 - \frac{1}{r_n}$, so we can substitute into the expression:

\[\frac{r_n^2}{r_n + 1} = r_n - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{r_n}} = r_n + r_n - 1 = 2r_n - 1.\]

If we sum these results for all roots, we have

\[\sum_{n = 1}^{98} (2r_n - 1).\]

Since we know that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is $-b/a$ (the negation of the coefficient of the degree $n-1$ term divided by the coefficient of the degree $n$ term, by Vieta's formula), we can find the sum of the roots of the polynomial $x^{98} + x^{97} + x^{96} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ is $0$ (since the coefficient of the degree $97$ term is $0$ and the coefficient of the degree $98$ term is $1$). Thus, the sum of the roots $r_n$ is 0, and the result of the given expression is

\[2 \cdot 0 - 98 = \boxed{-98}.\]

Problem 15 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{c}{a}

Reply: The $x$-intercepts of the parabola are the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, which are $p$ and $q$. Therefore by Vieta's formulas, $p+q = -\frac{b}{a}$ and $pq = \frac{c}{a}.$

For the circle that also passes through $(p,0)$ and $(q,0)$, the center of the circle will be the midpoint of the two points, $(\frac{p+q}{2}, 0)$, and the radius of the circle will be half of the distance between the two points, or $\frac{|p-q|}{2}$. 

The distance from the origin to the center of the circle is $\frac{p+q}{2}$, and by the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the tangent from the origin to the circle squared is:
\[ t^2 = \left(\frac{p+q}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{|p-q|}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{p+q}{2}\right)^2 + |pq|\]

Substituting $p+q = -\frac{b}{a}$ and $pq = \frac{c}{a}$, we get:
\[ t^2 = \left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right)^2 + \left|\frac{c}{a}\right| = \frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \left|\frac{c}{a}\right|\]
\[ = \frac{b^2 + 4a|c|}{4a^2}\]

So, $t^2 = \frac{b^2 + 4a|c|}{4a^2}.$

Check: the answer extracted from the reply is: "t^2 = \frac{b^2 + 4a|c|}{4a^2}."

comparing this with the ground truth answer, which is "\frac{c}{a}", it becomes evident that they do not match. the necessary and consistent terms aren't present in both equations, thus we can confirm they are not equivalent.

Problem 16 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{3}{7}

Reply: The given quantities are x ∈ [-5,-3] and y ∈ [2,4]. 

The expression $\frac{x+y}{x-y}$ will maximize when the numerator (x+y) is maximized, and the denominator (x-y) is minimized simultaneously based on simple optimization. 

The numerator (x+y) will be maximized when x is maximized and y too is maximized, i.e., x = -3 and y = 4. So, the maximum value of the numerator is (-3)+4 = 1.

The denominator (x-y) will be minimized when x is minimized and y is maximized, i.e., x = -5 and y = 4. So, the minimum value of the denominator is -5-4 = -9.

Therefore, the largest possible value of $\frac{x+y}{x-y}$ is $\frac{1}{-9}$ which equals -0.111.

Problem 17 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \sqrt{2}

Reply: By completing the square, we rewrite the expressions inside the square roots as follows:

\[-x^2 + 4x + 21 = -(x - 2)^2 + 25\]
\[-x^2 + 3x + 10 = -(x - 1.5)^2 + 11.25\]

Therefore, the function \(f(x)\) becomes:

\[f(x) = \sqrt{-(x - 2)^2 + 25} - \sqrt{-(x - 1.5)^2 + 11.25}.\]

The quantities inside the square roots are maximized when \(x - 2 = 0\) and \(x - 1.5 = 0\), respectively, which means \(x = 2\) and \(x = 1.5\). Both maxima cannot be achieved simultaneously, given that the maxima locations are different.

So taking the minimum of the two values for \(x\), we substitute \(x = 1.5\) into the equation to obtain:

\[f(1.5) = \sqrt{-(1.5 - 2)^2 + 25} - \sqrt{-(1.5 - 1.5)^2 + 11.25} = \sqrt{24.75} - \sqrt{11.25}.\]

Calculating the above expression approximately gives us:

\[f(1.5) = 4.98 - 3.35 = 1.63.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the function is approximately 1.63.
%%%%%%%
Check: the answer extracted from the reply is "the minimum value of the function is approximately 1.63".

the ground truth answer is \sqrt{2}, which is approximately equal to 1.414, not 1.63. 

despite the general approach is correct, it appears that a mistake has been made during the calculation.

so, the final decision is: "the answer is incorrect. correct answer: \sqrt{2} | answer extracted: 1.63."

Problem 18 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 10

Reply: Let's denote the degree 4 polynomial as \(P(x) = ax^4 + bx^2 + c\).

Note that the power of \(x\) in \(P(x)\) must be even since we have \(P(x) = P(-x)\). Therefore, even if \(P(x)\) is of degree 4, terms as \(x\) and \(x^3\) cannot be present there. We confirm that we have \(P(x) = ax^4 + bx^2 + c\) where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) can be any real number.

Now, we express the equality \(P(x^2) = P(x) P(-x)\) using the definition of \(P(x)\):

\((ax^4 + bx^2 + c) = (ax^4 + bx^2 + c)^2 \Rightarrow ax^4 + bx^2 + c = a^2x^8 + 2abx^6 + (2ac + b^2)x^4 + 2bcx^2 + c^2.\)

Matching coefficients, we obtain the following system of equations: 

1) \(a = a^2\)
2) \(b = 2ab + 2bc\)
3) \(c = a^2 + b^2 + c^2\)

The first equation has solutions \(a = 0\) and \(a = 1\).

If \(a = 0\), we get from the second equation that \(b = 2bc\). Then \(b = 0\) or \(c = 1\). Then \(c = b^2 + c^2\), and hence \(c = 0\) or \(c = 1\). So, if \(a = 0\) we have two solutions: \((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0)\) and \((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 1)\).

If \(a = 1\), we find from the second equation that \(2b = 2 + 2c\). Hence, \(b = 1 + c\). Then \(c = 1 + (1 + c)^2 + c^2\), so \(c^2 + (2c - 1)^2 = 1\). Solving this for \(c\), we get \(c = 0\) or \(c = 1\). Substituting these values into \(b = 1 + c\), we obtain that if \(a = 1\) we have two solutions again: \((a, b, c) = (1, 1, 0)\) and \((a, b, c) = (1, 2, 1)\).

So, we get a total of four solutions: \((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0);\ (0, 0, 1);\ (1, 1, 0);\ (1, 2, 1)\). Thus, there are 4 polynomials of degree 4 that satisfy the given equation.

Problem 19 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 134

Reply: Let's mathematically model that problem. Let's denote the number of votes for each candidate as v_i and the total number of votes as V. What's given is that v_i/V * 100 < v_i - 1 for each candidate. Solve it for V and we get V > 100 * v_i / (v_i - 1).

The smallest possible number of votes v_i that candidate can receive is 1 (since the candidate must receive at least one vote), so we substitute it into the expression and we get V > 100.

However, because each candidate must receive at least one vote and there are 27 candidates, the smallest number of votes necessary is actually 27. The percentage of votes that would correspond to each candidate receiving one vote is approximately 3.7%, which is less than all but one of the candidates. Thus, the number of committee members must be greater than 100.

The smallest number greater than 100 that is divisible by 27 (since each member gives one vote to one of the 27 candidates) is 108. Therefore, the smallest possible number of members of the committee is 108.
