  "problem": "While staying in a 15-story hotel, Polya plays the following game. She enters an elevator on the $6^{\\mathrm{th}}$ floor. She flips a fair coin five times to determine her next five stops. Each time she flips heads, she goes up one floor. Each time she flips tails, she goes down one floor. What is the probability that each of her next five stops is on the $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ floor or higher? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

  "solution": "If Polya is never to visit the sixth floor after she begins, we know that her first stop is at the seventh floor. Moreover, her second stop must be at the eighth floor. She has three moves left, and the only way she can ever visit the 6th floor from the 8th floor in three remaining moves is to go down in both of the following two steps. The probability of getting to the eighth step in two moves is $\\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. And the probability of not going downward in the next two steps is $1- \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. So the overall probability of never hitting the sixth floor after the beginning is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}.$",

  "response_with_ans": "One way to approach this problem is through the use of binary representations.\n\nThe situation can be viewed as having 5 binary digits, where 0 represents going down a floor (flipping tails) and 1 represents going up a floor (flipping heads). Since the hotel has 15 floors and Polya starts on the 6th floor, there are 10 more floors (including ground floor) she can potentially access.\n\nPolya wants to reach the 7th floor or higher with each of the next five stops. This eliminates possibilities where she ever gets a 0 (going down a floor) in the first two flips, because even if she gets all 1s (going up a floor) after that, the lowest floor she would reach is the 5th, not the 7th.\n\nThis leaves us with $2^5 = 32$ total possible outcomes of flips (since each flip has 2 possibilities). However, 4 of these flops are eliminated (00000, 00001, 00010, 00011, 00100, 00101), because they would lead to Polya being below the 7th floor at some point within the first two stops. \n\nThis gives us 26 remaining possibilities that are acceptable. So, the probability of Polya ending up on the 7th floor or higher with each of her next five stops is $\\frac{26}{32}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{13}{16}$. \n\nSo the probability is $\\frac{13}{16}$.",
