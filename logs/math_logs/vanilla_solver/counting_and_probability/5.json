  "problem": "Each of five, standard, six-sided dice is rolled once. Two of the dice come up the same, but the other three are all different from those two and different from each other. The pair is set aside, and the other three dice are re-rolled. The dice are said to show a \"full house\" if three of the dice show the same value and the other two show the same value (and potentially, but not necessarily, all five dice show the same value). What is the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house?",

  "solution": "There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside and the other two form a pair, we will have a full house. But we will also have a full house if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.\n\nConsider the first case. There are $3$ ways to pick which of the three dice will match a pair, and then $5$ ways to pick a value for the other two dice so that they form a pair (but don't match the first three dice), for a total of $3\\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nIn the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $5$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have so that they don't match the first pair, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nSo there are a total of $15+5=20$ ways to get a full house without all five dice matching, added to the possibility that all five dice match, which makes $21$ ways to get a full house. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{21}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{72}}.$$",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's break up the problem into two parts. \n\nThe first part is selecting a pair from the initial roll.\n\nIn the first roll, there are 5 dice. Two of them come up the same number, while the others are all different. The pair of dice can be any of the 6 numbers (from 1 to 6) and the other three dice are all different and different from the pair. There are ways of choosing 3 different numbers from the remaining 5, and a way of rearranging these 3 numbers among 3 dice. We do not care about the order of the two identical dice.\n\nSo, in total, there are:\n6 *(5 choose 3)* 3! = 6 * 10 * 6 = 360 ways to arrange the first roll.\n\nThe second part is the probability of rolling a full house.\n\nWhen we reroll the 3 dice, we are seeking one of two outcomes to have a full house:\n\n- Two of the three dice roll the same value as the original pair, and the other die rolls a different value, or;\n- All three dice roll a different value from the original pair but the same as each other.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each:\n\n1) The original pair was of a specific number, so there are 5 options left for the new die to show.\n   The probability of getting a specific number is (1/6), and we want to roll the same specific number twice out of three tries.\n   This is (3 choose 2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6) = 15/216.\n\n2) This time, we want all three dice to roll the same value, which is not the one of the original pair (5 choices left).\n   This is 5 * (1/6)^3 = 5/216.\n\nAdding these together, the total probability to get a full house is 15/216 + 5/216 = 20/216 = 5/54 \n\nTherefore, the probability that the dice show a full house after the second set of rolls is 5 out of 54, which can also be expressed as approximately 0.0926 or 9.26%.",
