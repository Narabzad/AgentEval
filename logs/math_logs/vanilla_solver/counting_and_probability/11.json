  "problem": "Two jokers are added to a $52$ card deck and the entire stack of $54$ cards is shuffled randomly.  What is the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "Each card has an equal likelihood of being either on top of the jokers, in between them, or below the jokers.  Thus, on average, $1/3$ of them will land between the two jokers. Multiplying this by the 52 yields our answer of $\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}$.",
  "correct_ans": "\\frac{52}{3}",

  "response_with_ans": "The process is similar to a line of 54 distinct positions, where we have to place 2 jokers. \nThere are ${54 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose 2 positions to place the jokers. \n\nThe number of cards strictly between the two jokers can vary from 0 to 52. \n\nFor exactly k cards to be between the jokers, there are 53 - k ways the jokers can be placed. With k cards between, the jokers occupy positions k + 1 and k + 2 in the sorted list of all cards. The smallest position k + 1 the first joker can occupy is 1 and the largest is 53 - k, so there are 53 - k such positions.\n\nThe expectation E(X) of the number of cards between the 2 jokers is sum of possible outcomes each multiplied by its probability.\n\nSo, E(X) = \u03a3 (k * P(X = k)) over k from 0 to 52.\n\nP(X = k) is equal to (Number of ways k cards can be between jokers)/(Total number of ways of placing 2 jokers) = (53 - k)/${54 \\choose 2}$\n\nE(X) = \u03a3 [k * (53 - k)/${54 \\choose 2}$] for k from 0 to 52.\n\nCalculating the above sum and simplifying, we obtain:\n\nE(X) = 25.5",
