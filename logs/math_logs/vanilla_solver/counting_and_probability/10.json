  "solution": "The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls. First, we pick which 3 of the 5 rolls are 1 or 2: we can do that in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways.  Now for each of these 3 rolls, there are 2 choices, and for each of the other 2 rolls, there are 4 choices.  Thus the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}2^34^2}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}.\\]",

  "response_with_ans": "To solve this problem, we need to use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWe know that:\n- The number of trials, n, is 5 (because we roll the die 5 times)\n- The number of successful outcomes we want, k, is 3 (we want exactly 3 rolls to be a 1 or 2)\n- The probability of success on any given roll, p, is 2/6 or 1/3 (because a 1 or a 2 is a \"success\" and the die has 6 faces)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(X=3) = C(5, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (1-(1/3))^(5-3)\n\nFirst, calculate the combination:\nC(5, 3) = 5! / [3!(5-3)!] = 10\n\nThen substitute this value and the given numbers into the equation:\n\nP(X=3) = 10 * (1/3)^3 * (1-(1/3))^(5-3)\n       = 10 * (1/27) * (2/3)^2\n       = 10 * (1/27) * (4/9)\n       = 40/243\n\nSo the probability that exactly 3 of the 5 rolls are either a 1 or a 2 on a fair 6-sided die is 40/243, or approximately 0.1646 (or 16.46% when expressed as a percentage).",
