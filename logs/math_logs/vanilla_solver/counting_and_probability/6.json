  "solution": "The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \\[ abc = 2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11,\\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter. There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct. Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct.\n\nFinally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \\[\\frac{240}{3!} = \\frac{240}{6} = \\boxed{40}.\\]",

  "response_with_ans": "First, find the prime factorization of 2310. This is $2*3*5*7*11$. \n\nThere are $5$ distinct prime factors. We want to divide these into three groups. We can count how many ways this can be done. \n\nThe easiest way to count this is to count how many ways we can divide $5$ distinct objects into $3$ distinct groups, then subtract off the ways we can divide $5$ distinct objects into $2$ or fewer distinct groups.\n\n1. There are $3^5=243$ ways to divide $5$ distinct objects into $3$ distinct groups, because each object has $3$ choices of which group it goes into.\n\n2. However, this overcounts the number of ways to divide $5$ distinct objects into $3$ distinct groups. Specifically, it includes the ways to divide $5$ distinct objects into $2$ or fewer distinct groups.\n\n3. There are $2^5=32$ ways to divide $5$ distinct objects into $1$ or $2$ distinct groups, because each object has $2$ choices of which group it goes into.\n\n4. There are $5$ ways to divide $5$ distinct objects into $1$ group, because there are $5$ choices of which single object forms its own group.\n\n5. So, there are $243-32-5=206$ ways to divide $5$ distinct objects into $3$ distinct groups.\n\nHowever, the problem requires that the three elements of the set are distinct. This means that each group must contain at least one prime and at most three primes.\n\nWe then must subtract off the $15$ ways in which one group gets $3$ primes (and thus another group gets $0$ primes), because this would mean two elements of the set are equal. \n\nThis leaves us with $206-15=191$ three-element sets.",
