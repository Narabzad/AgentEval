  "solution": "To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ such $n$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The function $*(n)$ generates a set of four values, and we are looking for situations where this set only contains three unique values. This happens when two of the four expressions (n-2, n+2, 2n, n/2) result in the same value.\n\nOne possibility is when $n-2=n+2$, but this cannot happen because the only solution to this equation (n=2) results in a contradiction because the set would contain four distinct elements {0, 4, 4, 1}.\n\nAnother possibility is when $n-2=2n$, but this cannot be because the only solution to this equation (n=-2) results in a contradiction because the set would contain four distinct elements {-4, 0, -4, -1}.\n\nA third possibility is when $n-2=n/2$, which gives us the solution n=4. In this case, the set is {2, 6, 8, 2} which indeed contains three distinct elements.\n\nA fourth possibility is when $n+2=2n$, which gives us the solution n=2. In this case, the set is {0, 4, 4, 1}, which contains three distinct elements too.\n\nAnother possibility is when $n+2=n/2$, but this cannot be because the only solution to this equation (n=-4) results in a contradiction because the set would contain four distinct elements {-6, -2, -8, -2}.\n\nFinally, the last possibility is when $2n=n/2$, but this cannot be because the only solution to this equation (n=0) results in a contradiction because the set would contain four distinct elements {-2, 2, 0, 0}.\n\nThus, there are exactly two distinct integer values of $n$ (4 and 2) that make $*(n)$ contain exactly three distinct elements.",
