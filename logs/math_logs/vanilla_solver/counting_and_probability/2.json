  "problem": "Three cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they are not all the same color?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.  So the answer is \\[1-2\\frac{\\binom{26}{3}}{\\binom{52}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}.\\]",

  "response_with_ans": "The total number of ways to draw 3 cards from a 52-card deck is 52C3, where \"C\" represents the combination function.\n\nThere are 2 colors in a standard deck, black (clubs and spades) and red (hearts and diamonds), each color having 26 cards.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 3 cards of the same color is 26C3 for black and 26C3 for red.\n\nSo the total ways to draw 3 cards of the same color is 2*26C3.\n\nThe probability that 3 cards drawn are the same color is [2*26C3] / 52C3\n\nThe probability that the 3 cards drawn are not the same color is 1 minus the probability that they are the same color.\n\nLet's calculate these values:\n\n52C3 = 22,100\n26C3 = 2,600\n2*26C3 = 5,200\n\nSo the probability that 3 cards are the same color is 5200/22100 = 0.2353\n\nSo the probability that the 3 cards are not the same color is 1 - 0.2353 = 0.7647 or approximately 76.47% when rounded to the nearest percentage point.",
