  "solution": "Consider the four random points before they are labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. In the general case, they will be distinct, forming a convex quadrilateral. Suppose $A$ is labeled. If $B$ is labeled as the vertex opposite $A$, segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect; otherwise, they will not. Since there are 3 points to label as $B$, the probability these segments intersect is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.

  "response_with_ans": "To compute this probability, let's assume that point $A$ is fixed (without loss of generality). Points $B$, $C$, and $D$ can be anywhere on the circumference of the circle, apart from the same location as $A$.\n\nIt's also to be noted that, for $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, $C$ must lie in the arc between $A$ and $B$, and $D$ should be outside.\n\n1. We first place $A$ randomly on the circle. This serves as our reference point and doesn't change anything as the circle is symmetric.\n2. We consider $B$ to be also placed randomly on the circle. Because the circle is continuous and $B$ cannot coincide with $A$, it 'divides' the circle into two arcs: one minor and one major(assuming $B$ is not the antipode of $A$ on the circle). For simplicity, we can just consider $B$ to be on the half-circle going counter-clockwise from $A$.\n3. Now, for the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, $C$ has to be on the 'arc' $AB$. As we said we only consider $B$ on the half circle going counter-clockwise, this corresponds to a $50\\%$ chance for $C$ to be in the right spot.\n4. Finally, $D$ simply has to be outside 'arc' $AC$ if we continue our drawing. This corresponds to another $50\\%$ chance.\n\nSo the probability of the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersecting is simply $0.5*0.5 = 0.25$ or $25\\%$.",
