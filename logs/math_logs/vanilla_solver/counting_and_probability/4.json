  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "The crocodiles must be separated from each other by one of the other creatures, so he must catch them first, third, fifth, and seventh. For the second, fourth, and sixth slots, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the remaining three creatures.\n\nHowever, there are two giant squid, so we must divide by $2!$, the number of ways to arrange the squid.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{3!}{2!}=\\boxed{3}$ ways.",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1. There are four crocodiles. Since the fisherman does not want to fish two crocodiles consecutively, he must catch another creature after catching a crocodile. So, we can think of all the other creatures (3 total) plus the non-consecutive sequences of crocodiles (4 total) as seven \"blocks.\" \n\n2. We need to distribute those seven \"blocks\" in different orders. If all the individuals were distinguishable, it would be 7! (7 factorial, or 7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72), however since the creatures of the same species are indistinguishable, we need to divide by the factorials of each type of creature to avoid over-counting sequences that are really the same.\n\n3. The four crocodiles can be arranged in any order and it will still be considered the same sequence, since they are indistinguishable. This is also true for the two giant squids.\n\nTherefore, \n\nThe answer should be 7! / (4! \u2217 2!) = (7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72) / (4\u00d73\u00d72\u00d72\u00d71) = 5\u00d77\u00d76 = 210 different ways to catch these creatures.",
