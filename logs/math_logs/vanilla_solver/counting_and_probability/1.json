  "solution": "We begin by finding all possible ways to arrange the 1, 2, 3, and 6.  There are only two orders which satisfy the conditions of the problem, namely $(1, 2, 3, 6)$ and $(1, 3, 2, 6)$.  We now insert the 4 into the lineup, keeping in mind that it must appear to the right of the 1 and 2.  There are three possible positions in the first case and two spots in the second case, bringing the total number of orderings to five.  Finally, when placing the 5 into any one of these orderings we need only ensure that it appears to the right of the 1, so there are five possibilities for each of our five orderings, making $\\boxed{25}$ orderings in all.",

  "response_with_ans": "The number of ways to write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row such that given any number in the row, all of its divisors (not including itself) appear to its left is 16. \n\nHere is how you can arrive at this answer:\n\nFirstly, it is clear that 1 must be first in the row as it is a divisor for every number.\n\nThen let's consider the next number, it can only be numbers that only have 1 as a divisor, hence it can be either 2 or 3 or 5. There are 3 options for the second place.\n\nLet's consider the third number. It can again be any prime number not yet used, which are two if we assume that the second number was a prime. Another option is to put 4 here, only if the second number was 2 (as 2 is a divisor of 4). Thus there are 3 options if the second number was a prime, and one option if the second number was 2. So in total there are 3*3 + 3 = 12 options for the third place.\n\nFor the fourth and the fifth number we repeat the logic. There are two remaining numbers, one of them is prime and another is either 6 (if 2 and 3 were used before) or prime (if the 4 has been used already). There are two options to place them: either the prime number comes first and then the non-prime number, or we could place the non-prime number before the prime number only if we previously used its divisors. So, in total there are 12*2 + 12*1 = 36 possibilities for fourth and fifth places.\n\nFinally, we place the remaining number at the 6th place. This leads to a total of 36 permutations.\n\nHowever, here, we have counted some cases twice as 4 or 6 might have been placed in the 4-th place, leaving us with two choices for the last two places. Specifically, we have counted twice when 6 is the 4th number and 2,3 are the remaining two numbers. As well as when 4 is the 4th number and 2,5 are the remaining two numbers. These are 2*2 = 4 cases.\n\nSo the final answer is 36-4 = 32. \n\nThe sequences that satisfy your condition are as follows:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n1 2 3 5 4 6\n1 2 4 3 5 6\n1 2 5 3 4 6\n1 3 2 4 5 6\n1 3 2 5 4 6\n1 3 4 2 5 6\n1 3 5 2 4 6\n1 5 2 3 4 6\n1 5 2 4 3 6\n1 5 3 2 4 6\n1 5 4 2 3 6\n1 2 3 6 4 5\n1 3 2 6 4 5\n1 2 4 6 3 5\n1 5 2 4 6 3\n\nI hope this was helpful.",
