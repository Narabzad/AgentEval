  "problem": "At a school, all 60 students play on at least one of three teams: Basketball, Soccer, and Mathletics. 8 students play all three sports, half the students play basketball, and the ratio of the size of the math team to the size of the basketball team to the size of the soccer team is $4:3:2$. How many students at the school play on exactly two teams?",

  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "We have enough information to solve for the size of each team. There are $\\dfrac{60}{2}=30$ members of the basketball team, $\\dfrac{4}{3}(30)=40$ members of the math team, and $\\dfrac{2}{3}(30)=20$ members of the soccer team. Adding these up gives us 90, so clearly we're overcounting since there are only 60 students. The number of times that each student is counted in this total is equal to the number of teams that student plays on. This means that all 60 students will be counted at least once, all students who play exactly two sports will be counted one extra time, and all students who play three sports will be counted two extra times. Letting $x$ be the number of students who play two sports and $y$ be the number who play all three gives us $60+x+2y=90$. However, we know that $y=8$, so we can substitute that in and get $x=\\boxed{14}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. We know that there are 60 students in the school and half of them play Basketball, which implies 30 students play Basketball.\n2. The ratio of the Math team to the Basketball team to the Soccer team is 4:3:2. Since ratios are relative to each other, let's try to figure out how many students each team consists of:\n   \n   To make it workable, let's assign a variable t to the elementary unit of the ratio which is derived by summing up all the parts of the ratio (4+3+2 = 9), therefore, t = 60/9 = 6.67 (This should be a whole number but it's a decimal, suggesting a conflict with given information).\n   \n   However, it is stated that half of the students play Basketball and we know how many this involves (30 students). From the ratio, we can determine that 3 parts represent the Basketball crew, so 1 part is equivalent to 30/3 = 10. This allows us to rectify the issue above.\n   \n   Now, knowing that 1 part equates 10, the Math team is comprised of 4 * 10 = 40 students, the Basketball team is comprised of 3 * 10 = 30 students, and the Soccer team is comprised of 2 * 10 = 20 students. Note that their sum exceeds 60, which indicates some students are on multiple teams.\n3. We are told that 8 students play all three sports. \n\n   If we subtract the 8 students that play all three from each team, we end up with:\n\n   - Math team = 40-8 = 32 students\n   - Basketball team = 30-8 = 22 students\n   - Soccer team = 20-8 = 12 students\n\n   This totals to 32+22+12 = 66, which is greater than 60, still indicating some students are multi-team members.\n4. The students who play on exactly two teams would be counted twice in the totals above, while those who play in all three teams would be counted thrice. To find those who play on exactly two teams mentioned above, we subtract the total school size from the sum of team counts(adjusted for players in all three sports): 66 - 60 = 6 students.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 students who play on exactly two teams.",
