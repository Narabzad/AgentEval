  "solution": "When two dice are rolled, there are 36 total outcomes. Let's compute the probability that Allen wins. Allen wins if the product of the two numbers is even and not a multiple of 3. In other words, Allen wins if the product is 2 $(1\\cdot2, 2\\cdot1)$, 4 $(1\\cdot4, 4\\cdot1, 2\\cdot2)$, 8 $(2\\cdot4, 4\\cdot2)$, 10 $(2\\cdot5, 5\\cdot2)$, 16 $(4\\cdot4)$, or 20 $(4\\cdot5, 5\\cdot4)$. Therefore, the probability that Allen wins is $\\frac{2+3+2+2+1+2}{36}=12/36=1/3$. Then, the probability that Jean wins is $1-1/3=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "We need to calculate the total possible outcomes of rolling two dice, then figure out how many of those outcomes result in a win for Jean, and finally express that as a ratio.\n\n1. Each die has 6 faces. So when rolling two dice, the total possible outcomes are 6*6 = 36.\n\n2. We now find the outcomes where the product of the numbers rolled is odd or a multiple of three. \n\n    i. The product is odd only when both the numbers are odd. There are three odd numbers on a die: 1, 3, and 5. So, there are 3*3 = 9 combinations where the product is odd.\n\n    ii. For the product to be a multiple of three, one of the numbers should be a multiple of three. The numbers 3 and 6 on the die are multiples of three. We have 2*6 = 12 combinations when the first number is 3 or 6. Similarly, we will have 12 more combinations when the second number is 3 or 6. So, there are a total of 24 combinations where the product is a multiple of three.\n\n    But, note that there are combinations where both the numbers are odd and a multiple of three. Those (3*3) are included twice in our count. There are 9 such combinations.\n\n    So, the total number of combinations where Jean wins are 9 (odd product) + 24 (multiples of three product) - 9 (combinations counted twice) = 24.\n\n3. So, the probability that Jean wins is the number of combinations that result in a win for Jean divided by the total possible outcomes:\n\n    (24/36) which simplifies down to 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Jean wins is 2/3.",
