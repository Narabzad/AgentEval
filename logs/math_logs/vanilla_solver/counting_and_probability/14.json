  "solution": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.",

  "response_with_ans": "This is a restricted circular permutation problem. This type of problem involves finding the number of ways to arrange items around a circle subject to certain restrictions. In this case, the restriction is that no two of the particular three people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) can sit next to each other. \n\nLet's consider two cases separately.\n\n1) Case one, all three of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are separated.\n\nFirstly, consider Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as one group (PRT), and the other four people as four individual groups. If we arrange these groups at a round table, there are $(5-1)!=4!$ ways according to the (n-1)! rule of circular permutations.\n\nWithin the PRT group, there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.\n\nSo, there are $4!*3!=576$ ways for this case.\n\n2) Case two, exactly two out of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are seated together.\n\nWe have three choices for the pair of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas who sit together, and two ways to arrange each pair. Consider the chosen pair and the person left as two groups (PT, R), and the other four people as four individual groups. If we arrange these groups at a round table, there are $(6-1)!=5!$ ways.\n\nSo, there are $3*2*5!=1440$ ways for this case.\n\nTherefore, adding up the cases, there are a total of $576+1440=2016$ ways in which $7$ people can sit around a round table such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.",
