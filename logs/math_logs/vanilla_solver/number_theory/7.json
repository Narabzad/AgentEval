  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "Let $2n-5$, $2n-3$, $2n-1$, $2n+1$, $2n+3$, and $2n+5$ be six consecutive positive odd numbers. Their sum is $(2n-5)+(2n-3)+(2n-1)+(2n+1)+(2n+3)+(2n+5)=12n$. Clearly, for any value of $n$, $12$ must divide the sum. By choosing $n=3$ and $n=5$, we can see that $\\boxed{12}$ is the largest whole number that must be a factor.",

  "response_with_ans": "The greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is 6. \n\nTo understand this, let's consider six consecutive odd numbers. They can be expressed as (2n-5), (2n-3), (2n-1), (2n+1), (2n+3), (2n+5) where n is any positive integer.\n\nAdding them together gives:\n\n6n, which is divisible by 6, regardless of the value of n. Hence, 6 is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers.\n",
