  "solution": "Recall that $a\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ if and only if $a-3$ is divisible by 7. Subtracting 3 from every element in the list gives  $$\n82 \\qquad 49,\\!476 \\qquad -70 \\qquad 12,\\!000,\\!000 \\qquad -6\n$$By dividing, we can see that 82 and $-6$ are not divisible by 7, whereas $-70$ and $49,\\!476$ are divisible by 7. To see that $12,\\!000,\\!000$ is not divisible by 7, note that its prime factorization is $(12)(10^6)=(2^2\\cdot 3)(2\\cdot 5)^6 = 2^8\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^6$. So, after striking off the numbers which are congruent to 3 (mod 7), the original list becomes $$\n85 \\qquad \\cancel{49,\\!479} \\qquad \\cancel{-67} \\qquad 12,\\!000,\\!003 \\qquad -3\n$$The sum of the remaining integers is $\\boxed{12,\\!000,\\!085}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "An integer is congruent to 3 (mod 7) if it leaves a remainder 3 when divided by 7. We can quickly test each integer:\n\n- 85 mod 7 equals 1, so 85 is not congruent to 3 (mod 7).\n- 49,479 mod 7 equals 0, so 49,479 is not congruent to 3 (mod 7).\n- -67 mod 7 equals -6, so -67 is not congruent to 3 (mod 7).\n- 12,000,003 mod 7 equals 3, so 12,000,003 is congruent to 3 (mod 7).\n- -3 mod 7 equals 4, so -3 is not congruent to 3 (mod 7).\n\nRemove the integer which is congruent to 3 (mod 7), which is 12,000,003.\n\nSumming up the remaining integers, we get:\n\n85 + 49,479 - 67 - 3 = 49,494.",
