  "solution": "First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 10$ palindromes.\n\nNext, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.\n\nNow we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$\n\nTherefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$\n\nSince there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\\frac{10}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "A four-digit palindrome must be in the form $\\underline{XYYX}$ where $X$ and $Y$ are digits. Let's consider the requirements on the digits imposed by their positions:\n \n* $X$ can be any digit from 1 to 9 inclusive (10 choices)\n* $Y$ may be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 choices)\n\nThe total number of four-digit palindromes is therefore $10 \\times 10 = 100$\n\nA multiple of $99$ is also a multiple of $9$ and a multiple of $11$, and therefore the sum of the digits must be a multiple of $9$ and alternating sum should be multiples of $11$ or zero.\n\nFor the sum of the digits to be a multiple of 9, $2X+2Y$ would have to be a multiple of 9 which could only be 9 or 18. The pairs of digits $(X, Y)$ that fit this requirement are $(1,4),\\ (1,9),\\ (2,3),\\ (2,8),\\ (3,2),\\ (3,7),\\ (4,1),\\ (4,6),\\ (5,5),\\ (5,0),\\ (6,4),\\ (6,9),\\ (7,3),\\ (7,8),\\ (8,2),\\ (8,7),\\ (9,1),\\ (9,6).$\n\nNext, considering the multiples of 11 for the alternating sum to be multiple of 11, $||2X-2Y||$ would have to be a multiple of 11 which could only be 0 or 11. In this case $(X, Y)$ could be $(1,1),\\ (2,2),\\ (3,3),\\ (4,4),\\ (5,5),\\ (6,6),\\ (7,7),\\ (8,8),\\ (9,9),\\ (5,0),\\ (6,1),\\ (7,2),\\ (8,3),\\ (9,4).$\n\nThe sets which satisfy both requirements are  $(1,4),\\ (2,3),\\ (4,1),\\ (3,2),\\ (5,5),\\ (5,0)$. So, there are 6 four-digit palindromes which are multiples of 99.\n\nThus, the probability is $\\dfrac{6}{100} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{50}}.$",
