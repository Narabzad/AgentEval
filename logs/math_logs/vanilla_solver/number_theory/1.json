  "problem": "A Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The problem seems to suggest a cycle of growth and death every hour, or 60 minutes. It seems each cycle starts with a certain number of Penteria, grows by 5 Penteria per minute for 60 minutes, and then everything except the initial amount dies.\n\nSince a cycle takes 60 minutes, we can find how many complete cycles the Penteria went through with 506 minutes. Thus, 506 minutes is 8 cycles of 60 minutes and then an additional 26 minutes.\n\nConsidering the additional 26 minutes, we can infer that 130 Penteria grew during this time as the increase rate is 5 per minute (5*26=130). Therefore, the initial number of Penteria must be 137 (the total number) minus 130 (the ones that grew), which equals 7.\n\nSo, there were 7 Penteria at the beginning.",
