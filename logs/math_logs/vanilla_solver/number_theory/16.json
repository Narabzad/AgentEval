  "problem": "What is the largest $n$ such that $a = 2^{306} \\cdot 3^{340}$ is a perfect $n$th power?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "We claim that $a$ is a perfect $n$th power if and only if $n$ divides both $306$ and $340$. To see this, suppose that $n \\mid 306$ and $n \\mid 340$. Then $2^{\\frac{306}{n}} 3^{\\frac{340}{n}}$ is an integer whose $n$th power is $a$. Conversely, suppose $b^n = a$. Then the only primes which divide $b$ are $2$ and $3$. Choose $c$ and $d$ so that $b=2^{c} 3^{d}$. Then $b^n = 2^{cn} 3^{dn} = 2^{306} 3^{340}$, which implies $n \\mid 306$ and $n \\mid 340$. This concludes our proof of the claim that $a$ is an $n$th power if and only if $n$ divides both $306$ and $340$.\n\nThe largest number which simultaneously divides two numbers is their GCD. Using the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD of $306$ and $340$ is the same as the GCD of $340$ and $340-306 = 34$. Since $34$ divides $340$, the GCD of these two is $34$, so the largest possible $n$ is $\\boxed{34}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "For a number to be a perfect nth power, all of its prime factor exponents must be divisible by n. \n\nIn the factorization of a, the smallest exponent is 306 for the prime number 2. \n\nTherefore, the largest nth power is the greatest divisor of both 306 and 340. This would be the greatest common divisor (GCD). \n\nThe GCD of 306 and 340 is 34. \n\nTherefore, the largest n such that a is a perfect nth power is 34.",
