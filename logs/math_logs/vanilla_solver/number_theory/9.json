  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "If $a$ is not relatively prime with $24$, then the modular inverse of $a$ does not exist. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $a$ yields that $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$, or equivalently that $a^2 - 1 \\equiv (a+1)(a-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$. Since $a$ is not divisible by $3$, it follows that at least one of $a+1$ or $a-1$ must be divisible by $3$. Also, since $a$ is not divisible by $2$, then both $a+1$ and $a-1$ are even, and exactly one of them is divisible by $4$. Thus, $3 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 24$ will always divide into $(a+1)(a-1)$, and so the statement is true for every integer $a$ relatively prime to $24$. The answer is the set of numbers relatively prime to $24$, namely $\\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\\}$. There are $\\boxed{8}$ such numbers.\n\nThe number of positive integers smaller than and relatively prime to $24$ is also given by the Euler's totient function.",

  "response_with_ans": "Given $a^{-1} \\equiv a \\pmod{24}$, this means that the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $24$ is $a$ itself. \n\nWe note that the inverse of $a$ modulo $24$ exists only if $a$ and $24$ are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is $1$). \n\nThe coprime numbers less than or equal to 23 are \n1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. \n\nHowever, not all of these numbers satisfy $a^{-1} \\equiv a \\pmod{24}$. We must check each individually. \n\nChecking manually yields only four numbers: $1^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$, $5^{-1} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{24}$, $7^{-1} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{24}$, and $23^{-1} \\equiv 23 \\pmod{24}$. \n\nSo, the total number of integers $a$ satisfying the given conditions is 4.",
