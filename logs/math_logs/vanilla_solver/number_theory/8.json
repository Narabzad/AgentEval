  "problem": "How many perfect square factors does the number 46,656 have?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "$46656=2^6\\cdot3^6$. So, $x$ is a factor of $46656$ if and only if there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $0\\le a\\le6$, $0\\le b\\le6$, and $x=2^a3^b$. Such an $x$ is a perfect square if and only if $a$ and $b$ are both even, which is true if and only if $a$ and $b$ are each 0, 2, 4, or 6. There are $4$ possible values of $a$, and $4$ possible values of $b$, so there are $4\\cdot4=\\boxed{16}$ possible values of $x$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The number 46,656 can be factored into prime numbers as:\n\n46,656 = 2^13 x 3^2\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square, all of the exponents in its prime factorisation should be even. To find the number of perfect square factors, you halve each of the exponents, add 1 to each, and then multiply them together.\n\nFor number 46,656:\n\nNumber of square divisors = (13/2 + 1) x (2/2 + 1) = 7 x 2 = 14\n\nSo, 46,656 has 14 perfect square factors.",

  "check_result": "1. the answer in the reply is: \"14\"\n\n2. the answer in the reply doesn't match the ground truth answer. the mistake comes from the incorrect computation of the number of square divisors. halving each exponent and adding 1 and then multiplying them together should have equaled 16, not 14. \n\n3. \"the answer is incorrect. correct answer: 16 | answer extracted: 14\"",
