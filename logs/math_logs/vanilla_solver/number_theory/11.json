  "solution": "Use the Euclidean algorithm on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. \\begin{align*}\nh(x) &= \\gcd(f(x), g(x)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(12x+7, 5x+2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5x+2, (12x+7)-2(5x+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5x+2, 2x + 3) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2x+3, (5x+2)-2(2x+3)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2x+3, x - 4) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(x-4, (2x+3)-2(x-4)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(x-4, 11)\n\\end{align*}From applying the Euclidean algorithm, we have that the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is 11 if and only if $x-4$ is a multiple of 11. For example, note that $f(4) = 55$ and $g(4) = 22$, and the greatest common divisor of 55 and 22 turns out to be 11. If $x-4$ is not a multiple of 11, then the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be one, since 11 is prime and therefore has no other factors. It follows that $h(x)$ can take on two distinct values; 1 and 11. The sum of all possible values of $h(x)$ is therefore $1 + 11 = \\boxed{12}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. \n\nHere, we are given two functions $f(x) = 12x + 7$ and $g(x) = 5x + 2$ and asked to find $h(x)$, the GCD of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's find $f(x)$ - $g(x)$ = $(12x+7) - (5x+2) = 7x + 5$\n\nNote that 7x + 5 is a multiple of 7x by the distributive property, and hence the GCD of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be a divisor of 7, which are -7, -1, 1, and 7. Given that x is a positive integer, obtain the GCD by checking whether $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are divisible by the positive values 1 and 7 for x=1 as a simple test case. \n\nNow, we substitute $x=1$ into $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and test the divisibility by 1 and 7. \n\n$f(1) = 12(1) + 7 = 19$ and $g(1) = 5(1) + 2 = 7$\n\nClearly, 19 and 7 are divisible by 1, so 1 is a value of h(x). \n\nHowever, neither 19 nor 7 is divisible by 7 without remainder, so h(x) cannot take the value 7.\n\nSince the only positive integer value that h(x) can take is 1, the sum of all possible values is just 1.\n",
