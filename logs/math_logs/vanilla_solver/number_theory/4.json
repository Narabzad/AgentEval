  "problem": "There are two cameras that take pictures of a traffic intersection. Camera A starts taking pictures at $6$ AM and takes a picture every $11$ minutes. Camera B starts taking pictures at $7$ AM and takes pictures every $7$ minutes. Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time at four different times before noon. When Camera A and Camera B take their last picture together, how many minutes before noon is it?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "If Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time, they will take a picture $77$ minutes later at the same time. Therefore, if we can find the first time they take a picture together, then we can continue adding $77$ minutes to figure out when the fourth picture was taken. Camera A's first pictures after $7$ AM is at $7:06$, followed by $7:17$ and $7:28$. Camera B will take a picture at $7:28$. From here, we add $77$ minutes until we have taken four pictures. $7:28$ is followed by $8:45$, which is followed by $10:02$, which is followed by $11:19$. This is $\\boxed{41}$ minutes before noon.",

  "response_with_ans": "Camera A and Camera B operate on different schedules. To find out how often they shoot pictures at the same time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their frequencies. The LCM of 11 and 7 is 77. This means that every 77 minutes, both cameras take a picture at the same time. \n\nCamera A starts operating an hour before Camera B, at 6 AM, so by 7 AM (when Camera B starts working), it will have already been working for 60 minutes. Now, we will find the largest multiple of 77 that fits into the time frame between 7 AM and noon, 5 hours or 300 minutes. This is 231 minutes which is 3*77. \n\nThis means the cameras take a picture together at 7 AM + 231 minutes = 11:51 AM. \n\nThus, the end of this period is noon - 11:51 AM = 9 minutes before noon.",

  "check_result": "the answer extracted from the reply is \"9 minutes before noon\".\n\nthe answer in the reply does not match the ground truth answer. the problem asks for how many minutes before noon the last joint picture is taken by the two cameras. the explanation and calculations in the reply might seem logical, but they are incorrect. in this problem, camera a starts operating an hour before camera b, this means it already had a lead of 60/11 = about 5 pics when camera b starts operating. we are looking for the 4th picture taken together, which means we should calculate: 7am + 4*77min -60min (this subtraction is due to the fact that camera a was already operating for an hour before camera b started).\n\n\"the answer is incorrect. correct answer: 41 | answer extracted: 9 minutes before noon.\"",
