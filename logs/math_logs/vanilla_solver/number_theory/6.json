  "solution": "Note the prime factorizations $700=2^2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$ and $7000=2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7$.\n\nIf $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,700]=7000$, then in particular, $r$ is a divisor of $7000$, so we can write $r=2^\\alpha\\cdot 5^\\beta\\cdot 7^\\gamma$, where $0\\le\\alpha\\le 3$, $0\\le\\beta\\le 3$, and $0\\le\\gamma\\le 1$.\n\nMoreover, we know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,700]=2^{\\max\\{\\alpha,2\\}}\\cdot 5^{\\max\\{\\beta,2\\}}\\cdot 7^{\\max\\{\\gamma,1\\}}$, and we know that this is equal to $7000=2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7$. This is possible only if $\\alpha=3$ and $\\beta=3$, but $\\gamma$ can be $0$ or $1$, giving us two choices for $r$: $$r = 2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^0 = 1000 \\text{~~or~~} r=2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^1 = 7000.$$So the sum of all solutions is $1000+7000=\\boxed{8000}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. In this case, we're given that the lcm of $r$ and $700$ is $7000$. The number 700 can be factored into $2^2 * 5^2 * 7^1$, and 7000 can be factored into $2^3 * 5^3 * 7^1$. \n\nFor two numbers, the lcm is derived by taking each distinct prime factor to the highest power it appears in either factorization. \n\nSince the lcm and one of the numbers are given, this means $r$ must \u201ccontribute\u201d the 'missing' factors to reach the lcm from the given number. From 700 to 7000, the 'missing' factors are one factor of $2$ and one factor of $5$. Hence, $r$ must be a multiple of these missing factors - $2$ and $5$ (but not $7$, as it's already in the prime factorisation of $700$ with needed power), which is $2*5=10$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all $r$ that satisfy the conditions is $10$, since there's just one such integer $r$.",
