  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "All factors of $2^5\\cdot 3^6$ that are perfect squares must be in the form $(2^m\\cdot 3^n)^2=2^{2m}\\cdot 3^{2n}$, where $0\\le2m\\le5$ and $0\\le2n\\le6$ for integers $m$ and $n$. Thus, $0\\le m\\le2$ and $0\\le n\\le3$, for a total of $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ factors that are perfect squares.",

  "response_with_ans": "To find out how many factors of a number ($2^5\\cdot3^6$ here) are perfect squares, check out all the possibilities of powers that would lead to perfect squares.\n\nFor 2^5 (which is the prime 2 raised to the power of 5), the even powers would give us perfect square factors, that is 0, 2, 4. This means, we have three choices or possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, for 3^6 (the prime 3 raised to the power of 6), the even powers like 0, 2, 4, 6 would give us perfect square factors. So we have four choices here.\n\nAs these two sets of factors (from 2^5 and 3^6) are independent, we can use the multiplication principle of counting to find the total number of perfect square factors, i.e., multiply the number of choices together: 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 factors of $2^5\\cdot3^6$ that are perfect squares.",
