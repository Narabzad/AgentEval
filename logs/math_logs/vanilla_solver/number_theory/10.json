  "solution": "For an integer $abcde$ to be divisible by $11$ then $a-b+c-d+e$ is divisible by $11.$\n\nWe start with the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 0.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d.$ Since we have a palindrome, we must have $a = e$ and $b = d,$ meaning that $2a+c=2b.$ We must have that $a$ and $e$ must be at least $1,$ so then we can let $b$ and $d$ also be 1 and $c$ be zero. So the smallest such five-digit palindrome is $11011.$\n\nThen, we investigate the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 11.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d+11,$ and $a = e$ and $b = d,$ so  $2a + c = 11 + 2b.$ We see that we can let $a$ be 1 and $c$ be 9, then $b = 0,$ and we have the palindrome $10901.$\n\nFinally, $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = -11.$ Then, $2a + c = 2b - 11.$ We check if $a = 1$ has any solutions. We get $2 + c = 2b - 11,$ so $c - 2b = -9.$ Then, we can see that there are no solutions for $b = 0$, since then we would have $c = -9.$ Since we already found $10901,$ we do not need to check for any $b$ greater than $0$, so we see that our solution is $\\boxed{10901}.$",

  "response_with_ans": "A palindrome is a number which reads the same forward and backward. A five-digit palindrome has the form $abcba$.\n\nThe trick to this problem is to find out that any number of the form $abcba$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $a+b = b+c$ i.e., the sum of the first and last digit and the middle digit equals twice the second digit.\n\nFor $a$, the possibilities are 1 through 9 (since it's a five-digit number). For each $a$, $b$, and $c$, giving a total of 9 * 10 * 10 = 900 options. \n\nStarting with 10001 (where a = 1, b = 0, c = 0), the next option is 10010 (where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1). But 11 doesn't divide into 10010. 10010 + 11 = 10021 is the next number that could possibly work because the sum of the first and last digits and the middle digit equals twice the second digit. But it's not a palindrome. \n\nIncrementing $c$ by 1 each time and checking whether the result is a palindrome and divisible by 11, we find that $10101$ is divisible by 11 and is also a palindrome. So this is the smallest five-digit palindrome divisible by 11.",
