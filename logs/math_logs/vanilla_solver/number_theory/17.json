  "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 3) \\cdot x(x + 3)}{40} = \\frac{x(x + 3)^2}{40}.\\] To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when $x = 5$, this expression is $5 \\cdot 8^2/40 = 8$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 8 and 40 is 8, and $x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8$.  The least common multiple is 40, and $x(x + 3) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 3) = 40$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{8}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's say the other number is $y$. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40 and $y$ is $x+3$ and the least common multiple (LCM) is $x(x+3)$.\n\nA number property known as product of the GCD and LCM of two integers formula is used here. This states that for any two integers a and b, `GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b`\n\nSo applying this property to our case:\n\n$(x+3) * x(x+3) = 40 * y$.\n\nNow considering that $x$ is a positive integer, let's try out some values.\n\nThe GCD of 40 and y is $x+3$, and since GCD stands for greatest common divisor, this should be a factor of 40. The factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40. Hence, $x+3$ should be among these factors, which means $x$ should be one of -2, -1, 1, 2, 5, 7, 17, and 37.\n\nLet's omit negative values of $x$ since $x$ is a positive integer, and that leaves us with $x$ being 1, 2, 5, 7, 17, or 37.\n\nOf these, only for $x=5$ and $x=17$ does $(x+3)*x(x+3)$ yield a product that is a multiple of 40 (i.e., $y$ is a whole number), which is mandatory for the given relationship to hold true. So $x$ can only be 5 or 17.\n\nIf $x = 5$, then $y = 320$.\nIf $x = 17$, then $y = 80$.\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of the other number is 80.",
