  "solution": "Let $k = n+2005$. Since $1 \\le n \\le 9999$, we have $2006 \\le k \\le 12004$. We know that $k$ has exactly 21 positive factors. The number of positive factors of a positive integer with prime factorization $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_r^{e_r}$ is $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots(e_r+1)$. Since $21 = 7 \\cdot 3$ and 7 and 3 are prime, the prime factorization of $k$ is either of the form $p^{20}$ or $p^6 q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers. Since $p^{20} \\geq 2^{20} > 12004$ for any prime $p$, we can't have the first form. So $k = p^6 q^2$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q$.\n\nIf $p=2$, then $k=64q^2$. So $2006 \\le 64q^2 \\le 12004 \\Rightarrow 31.34375 \\le q^2 \\le 187.5625$. For $q$ an integer, this holds when $6 \\le q \\le 13$. Since $q$ is prime, $q$ is 7, 11, or 13. So if $p=2$, the possible values of $k$ are $2^6 7^2 = 3136$, $2^6 11^2 = 7744$, and $2^6 13^2 = 10816$.\n\nIf $p=3$, then $k = 729q^2$. So $2006 \\le 729q^2 \\le 12004 \\Rightarrow 2.75\\ldots \\le q^2 \\le 16.46\\ldots$. For $q$ an integer, this holds when $2 \\le q \\le 4$. Since $q$ is a prime distinct from $p=3$, we have $q=2$. So if $p=3$, $k = 3^6 2^2 = 2916$.\n\nIf $p \\ge 5$, then $k \\ge 15625q^2 > 12004$, a contradiction. So we have found all possible values of $k$. The sum of the possible values of $n = k - 2005$ is thus \\begin{align*}\n&(3136-2005) \\\\\n+ &(7744-2005)\\\\\n+ &(10816-2005)\\\\\n+ &(2916-2005)\\\\\n= &\\boxed{16592}.\n\\end{align*}",

  "response_with_ans": "Let $n + 2005 = m$. We are given that $m$ has exactly $21$ factors.\n\nWe remember the result from number theory which states that \"If a number has prime factorization $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} ... p_k^{e_k}$, where the $p_i$ are distinct primes and $e_i > 0$ for all $i$, then the number of factors of the number is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_k + 1)$\".\n\nSo, in this case, we try to find all the ways to multiply together positive integers to get 21. They are $1 \\times 21$, and $3 \\times 7$. \n\nThis means the prime factorization of $m$ could look like $p_1^{20}$, $p_1^{2}p_2^{6}$, or $p_1^{2}p_2^2p_3^4$.\n\nFor case $p_1^{20}$: this means $m = p_1^{20}$. However, the smallest $p_1$ is $2$, and $2^{20}$ is much larger than $10{,}000$, so this case is not possible.\n\nFor case $p_1^{2}p_2^{6}$: even for the smallest primes $2$ and $3$, we get $2^{2} \\times 3^{6}$, which is greater than  $10{,}000$. \n\nFinally, for case $p_1^{2}p_2^{2}p_3^{4}$: we can generate these possibilities by picking from the least primes. $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4 = 22500$, which is greater than $10000$. Since this combination is already larger than $10000$, any other combination will also be larger. \n\nSo we conclude that, actually, there are no possible values of $n$ satisfying $n + 2005$ has exactly 21 positive factors. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values for $n$ is 0.",
