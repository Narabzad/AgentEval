  "problem": "Bekah has exactly three brass house number digits: 2, 3 and 5. How many distinct numbers can she form using one or more of the digits?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "If Bekah uses only one digit, she can form three numbers. If she uses two digits, she has three choices for the tens place and two for the units, so she can form six numbers. Finally, if Bekah uses all three digits, she has three choices for the hundreds place, two for the tens, and one for the units, so she can form six numbers. Thus, Bekah can form $3 + 6 + 6 = \\boxed{15}$ distinct numbers.",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's break this down by the number of digits in each number she can form.\n\n- One-digit numbers: There are 3 possibilities, because each of the digits 2, 3, and 5 can form a one-digit number.\n\n- Two-digit numbers: The first digit can be any of the 3 digits and the second digit can be any of the remaining 2, so there are 3*2 = 6 possibilities.\n\n- Three-digit numbers: There is only one way to arrange all 3 different digits in a three-digit number, which is simply 235.\n\nSo adding these together, Bekah can form 3 (one-digit numbers) + 6 (two-digit numbers) + 1 (three-digit number) = 10 distinct numbers.",

  "check_result": "the answer extracted is \"10\".\n\nthe ground truth answer is \"15\".\n\nthe problem asks how many distinct numbers bekah can form using one or more of the brass house number digits, 2, 3 and 5. but the reply from the user incorrectly states that there is only one way to arrange all 3 different digits in a three-digit number, which leads to the wrong total.\n\nso, the answer is incorrect. correct answer: 15 | answer extracted: 10.",
