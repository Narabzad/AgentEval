  "problem": "All 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have distinct two-letter postal abbreviations. If a two-letter sequence of letters (such as CO or EE) is chosen at random, what is the probability that it is a postal abbreviation for one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "There are $26\\cdot 26$ possible two-letter sequences of letters, since we have 26 choices for the first and then 26 choices for the second.  But only 52 of these possibilities are valid, so our answer is $\\frac{52}{26\\cdot 26} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1}{13}}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The total number of possible two-letter combinations is 26*26 (for the 26 letters in the English alphabet), which equals 676. \n\nThere are 50 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, making 52 valid two-letter postal abbreviations. \n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen two-letter sequence is a postal abbreviation for one of these regions is 52/676. \n\nReducing this fraction to its simplest form, the probability is 13/169.",
