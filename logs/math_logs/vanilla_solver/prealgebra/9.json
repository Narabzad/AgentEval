  "problem": "What is the product of $0.\\overline{05}$ and $1.8$ expressed as a fraction in simplest form?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{05}$ to a fraction. Let's define $x=0.\\overline{05}$. If we multiply both sides by $100$ we get $100x=5.\\overline{05}$ so $99x=5$ and $x=0.\\overline{05}=\\frac{5}{99}$. Since $1.8=\\frac{9}{5}$ we get  $$\\frac{\\cancel{5}}{99}\\cdot\\frac{9}{\\cancel{5}}=\\frac{9}{99}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}.$$",
  "correct_ans": "\\frac{1}{11}",
  "problem_id": "9",
  "response_with_ans": "The decimal $0.\\overline{05}$ represents the repeating decimal 0.050505... and can be expressed as the fraction 5/99, because the repetitive decimal can be converted to the fraction using this formula, i.e. repetitive decimal = repetitive section / (the same amount of 9s as the section's digit count). \n\nSo, the product of $0.\\overline{05}$ and $1.8$ is \n(5/99) * (1.8) or (5*1.8) / 99 = (9 / 99) = 1/11 after simplifying, assuming that 1.8 was converted to 9/5 to express it as a fraction. \n\nSo, the product of $0.\\overline{05}$ and $1.8$ expressed as a fraction in simplest form is 1/11.",
