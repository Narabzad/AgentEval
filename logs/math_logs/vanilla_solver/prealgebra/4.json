  "problem": "John counts up from 1 to 13, and then immediately counts down again to 1, and then back up to 13, and so on, alternately counting up and down: \\begin{align*}\n&(1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,\\ldots ).\n\\end{align*} What is the $5000^{\\text{th}}$ integer in his list?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "We can treat this list as a sequence with a repetitive pattern. We see the sequence repeats itself every 24 elements (from 1 to 13 then back to 2). When 5000 is divided by 24, its remainder is 8. Therefore we see the $5000^{\\text{th}}$ integer is the same as the $8^{\\text{th}}$ integer, which is $\\boxed{8}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "John counts 25 numbers each complete cycle (up to 13 and back to 1). We first find how many complete cycles John goes through before he reaches the 5000th number. We divide 5000 by 25, which equals 200 with no remainder, indicating that John completes 200 full cycles without reaching the 5000th number.\n\nTo find out the exact number John says at the 5000th step, we need to find what the next number is after 200 complete cycles. Since a complete cycle ends with him saying \"1\", he would be saying \"2\" (beginning of the next cycle), which is the 5000th integer.",

  "check_result": "the answer in the reply is: 2\n\nthe ground truth answer is: 8\n\nchecking the statements there seems to be a computational error. the division of 5000 by 25 equals to 200, this part they got correct but it means that there are 200 complete full cycles, not less than 200. the person has incorrectly stated that the number sequence starts over at \"2\" for the 5001th number, when in fact it's the \"1\" itself i.e., 200*25=5000th number which is '1'. hence 5001th number will be '2'. the 5000th integer (number being said in the sequence) should be '1' and not '2'.\n\nthe answer is incorrect. correct answer: 8 | answer extracted: 2.",
