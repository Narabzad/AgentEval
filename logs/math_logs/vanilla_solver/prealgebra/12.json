  "problem": "Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1. How many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime with 28?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot 7$, a positive integer is relatively prime with $28$ if and only if it contains neither $2$ nor $7$ in its prime factorization. In other words, we want to count the number of integers between $11$ and $29$ inclusive which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $7$.\n\nAll of the odd numbers are not divisible by 2; there are 10 such numbers.  The only one of these that is divisible by 7 is 21, so there are $10- 1 =\\boxed{9}$ numbers between 10 and 30 that are relatively prime with 28.",

  "response_with_ans": "Relatively prime numbers (or coprime) are numbers whose greatest common factor (GCF) is 1. This means they share no prime factors. For a number to be coprime with 28, it cannot share the prime factors 2 and 7 (since 28 = 2*2*7). \n\nSo, let's check the numbers between 10 and 30 and see which ones don't share these prime factors:\n\n11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29\n\nYou can immediately rule out any even numbers, as well as 21 (which is divisible by 7) and 15, 25 (which are divisible by 5).\n\nSo, the numbers are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 27, 29. \n\nIn total we have 7 numbers that are relatively prime with 28.",

  "check_result": "the answer extracted from the reply is: \"7\"\n\nthe problem is asking for the number of integers greater than 10 and less than 30 that are relatively prime with 28. the reply determines this by finding the numbers that don't share prime factors with 28. however, the reply made an error by omitting numbers 15 and 25, which are relatively prime to 28. hence, the ground truth answer is 9, not the 7 given in the reply.\n\ntherefore, \"the answer is incorrect. correct answer: 9 | answer extracted: 7.\"",
