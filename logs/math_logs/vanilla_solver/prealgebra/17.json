  "problem": "What is the sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of the two legs of a 30-60-90 right triangle, if the length of the hypotenuse is $2\\sqrt{6}$ centimeters?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "We know that the ratio of the lengths of the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. We know that the length of the hypotenuse is $2\\sqrt{6}$ and the ratio of the length shortest leg to that of the hypotenuse is $1:2$. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\\sqrt{6}$. Since the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $1:\\sqrt{3}$, the length of the longer leg is $\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. The sum of the lengths of these two legs is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters.",

  "response_with_ans": "In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2. Let's denote the shorter leg (opposite the 30-degree angle) as a, the longer leg (opposite the 60-degree angle) as b, and the hypotenuse as c. \n\nGiven that c (hypotenuse) is 2\u221a6 cm, according to the ratio:\nc = 2a, therefore, a = c/2 = 2\u221a6/2 = \u221a6 cm. \n\nThe other side, b \nb = \u221a3 * a = \u221a3 * \u221a6 = \u221a18 cm = 3\u221a2 cm (since \u221a18 can be simplified to 3\u221a2). \n\nThus, the sum of the lengths of the two legs of the triangle is:\na+b = \u221a6 cm + 3\u221a2 cm = (\u221a6 + 3\u221a2) cm.",
