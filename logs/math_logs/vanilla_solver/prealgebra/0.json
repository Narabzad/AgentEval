  "solution": "Since $\\angle PAB$ and $\\angle BAC$ are supplementary, $\\angle BAC = 180^{\\circ} - x^\\circ$.  Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $ 180^{\\circ} $, we have $\\angle ACB = 180^{\\circ} - 90^{\\circ} - (180^{\\circ} - x^\\circ) = x^\\circ - 90^{\\circ}$.  Thus, $M + N = \\boxed{-89}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "Given that triangle ABC is a right triangle, as shown by the right angle sign at angle ACB, angle A and angle B must add up to 90 degrees because the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\n\nSince angle PAB is x degrees and angle ABC shares the same vector as angle PAB, the measurement of angle ABC must be x degrees as well. \n\nThen, angle ACB = 90 - x, which can be expressed in the form $(Mx+N)^\\circ$ where M = -1 and N = 90.\n\nTo find the value of \"M + N\", add the constants: -1 + 90 = 89.
