  "problem": "The perfect squares from $1$ through $2500,$ inclusive, are printed in a sequence of digits $1491625\\ldots2500.$ How many digits are in the sequence?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "We consider it by four cases:\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: There are $3$ perfect squares that only have $1$ digit, $1^{2},$ $2^{2},$ and $3^{2}.$\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: The smallest perfect square that has $2$ digits is $4^{2},$ and the largest is $9^{2},$ so that's a total of $6$ perfect squares with $2$ digits.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: The smallest perfect square with $3$ digits is $10^{2},$ and the largest is $31^{2},$ yielding a total of $22.$\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 4: The smallest perfect square with $4$ digits is $32^{2},$ and the last one that is no greater than $2500$ is $50^{2},$ giving a total of $19.$\n\nSo we have a total of $1\\times3+2\\times6+3\\times22+4\\times19=\\boxed{157}$ digits.",

  "response_with_ans": "First, let's figure out how many perfect squares there are from $1$ through $2500$, inclusive. That can be easily determined by finding the square roots of $1$ and $2500$. That would be $1$ through $50$, inclusive. So there are $50$ perfect squares.\n\nThen let's calculate how many digits each perfect square has. A $1$-digit perfect square is in the range of $1^2$ to $3^2$, yielding $3$ such perfect squares. A $2$-digit perfect square is in the range of $4^2$ to $9^2$, yielding $6$ such perfect squares. A $3$-digit perfect square is in the range of $10^2$ to $31^2$, yielding $22$ perfect squares. A $4$-digit perfect square is in the range of $32^2$ to $50^2$, yielding $19$ perfect squares. \n\nSo, adding up all the digits, the total would be \n$1*3 + 2*6 + 3*22 + 4*19 = 3 + 12 + 66 + 76 = 157$. Hence, there are $157$ digits in the sequence.",
