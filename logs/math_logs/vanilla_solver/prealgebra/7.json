  "solution": "Multiply the short leg of the right triangle by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find that the length of the longer leg is $6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  Double the short leg of the right triangle to find that the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 12 units.  Since the hypotenuse of the right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, the side length of the equilateral triangle is also 12 units.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance between the two vertices that the two triangles do not have in common is $\\sqrt{(6\\sqrt{3})^2+12^2}=\\sqrt{252}=\\boxed{6\\sqrt{7}}$ units.

  "check_result": "the answer in the reply is \"12-6\\sqrt{3}\".\n\nfollowing the method stated in the reply, subtracting the length of the longer leg of a 30-60-90 triangle (which is 6\\sqrt{3} units) from the length of the side of the equilateral triangle (which is 12 units) gives us 12-6\\sqrt{3} units. but the ground truth answer is given as 6\\sqrt{7}.\n\nlet's verify whether the two answers are the same.\n\nif they're equivalent, (12-6\\sqrt{3})^2 should be equal to (6\\sqrt{7})^2.\n\n(12-6\\sqrt{3})^2 = 144 - 144\\sqrt{3} + 108 \n(6\\sqrt{7})^2 = 252\n\nclearly, 144 - 144\\sqrt{3} + 108 \u2260 252, meaning 12-6\\sqrt{3} \u2260 6\\sqrt{7} in terms of real numbers.\n\nso, the answer \"12-6\\sqrt{3}\" in the reply is incorrect. the correct answer should be \"6\\sqrt{7}\".\n\nso, \"the answer is incorrect. correct answer: 6\\sqrt{7} | answer extracted: 12-6\\sqrt{3}\".",
