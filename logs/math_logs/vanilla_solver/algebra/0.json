  "solution": "We have \\begin{align*} (2x+10)(x+3)&<(3x+9)(x+8) \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ 2(x+5)(x+3)&<3(x+3)(x+8) \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ 2(x+5)(x+3)-3(x+3)(x+8)&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (2x+10-(3x+24))(x+3)&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (-x-14)(x+3)&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (x+14)(x+3)&>0.\n\\end{align*} This inequality is satisfied if and only if $(x+14)$ and $(x+3)$ are either both positive or both negative.  Both factors are positive for $x>-3$ and both factors are negative for $x<-14$.  When $-14<x<-3$, one factor is positive and the other negative, so their product is negative.   Therefore, the range of $x$ that satisfies the inequality is $ \\boxed{(-\\infty, -14)\\cup(-3,\\infty)} $.",

  "response_with_ans": "To solve the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we first simplify and solve for $x$ as if it were an equation. \n\n$(2x+10)(x+3) = (3x+9)(x+8)$\n\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get:\n\n$2x^2+30x+30 = 3x^2+33x+72$\n\nRearranging to get all terms on one side, we get:\n\n$x^2+3x-42 = 0$\n\nThis can be factored to:\n\n$(x-6)(x+7) = 0$\n\nSo, $x = 6, -7$ are the solutions to the corresponding equation. \n\nHowever, because the inequality has a \"<\" sign, we need to test values of $x$ in each of the intervals formed by $x = -7$ and $x = 6$ to see where the inequality is satisfied.\n\n1. Test a value less than $-7$, such as $x = -8$: \n   \n    $(2*-8+10)*(-8+3) = -50$\n   \n    $(3*-8+9)*(-8+8) = 0$\n\n    Since $-50 < 0$, the inequality is true for $x < -7$.\n   \n2. Test a value between $-7$ and $6$, such as $x = 0: \n\n   $(2*0+10)*(0+3) = 30$\n   \n   $(3*0+9)*(0+8) = 72$\n\n   Since $30 < 72$, the inequality is true for $-7 < x < 6$.\n\n3. Test a value greater than $6$, such as $x = 7$:\n\n   $(2*7+10)*(7+3) = 270$\n   \n   $(3*7+9)*(7+8) = 378$\n\n   Since $270 < 378$, the inequality is not satisfied for $x > 6$.\n   \nTherefore, the solution to the inequality is $x$ in the open interval $(-\\infty,-7]$ and $(-7, 6)$. In interval notation, the solution can be written as:\n\n$x \\in (-\\infty,-7] \\cup (-7, 6)$.",
