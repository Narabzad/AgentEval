  "solution": "Seeing that factoring will not work, we apply the Quadratic Formula: \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-(5) \\pm \\sqrt{(5)^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2 (1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 32}}{2} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{-7}}{2} = -\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}i.\n\\end{align*} Now we see that $a = -\\dfrac{5}{2}$ and $b = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2},$ so $a + b^2 = -\\dfrac{5}{2} + \\dfrac{7}{4} = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{3}{4}}.$",

  "response_with_ans": "We can solve this equation by using the quadratic formula: \n\n$x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a$\n\nThis gives: \n\n$x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt((5^2) - 4*1*8)] / 2*1$\n$x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 - 32)] / 2$\n$x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(-7)] / 2$\n\nWe can then see that the square root of -7 is a complex number, and we can write it as the imaginary i times the square root of 7 because: \n\nsqrt(-1) = i, so sqrt(-7) = sqrt(7) * i\n\nTherefore we have:\n\n$x = -5/2 \u00b1 sqrt(7)/2 * i$\n\nComparing this to the form $x = a + bi$ shows that $a = -5/2$ and $b = sqrt(7)/2$. \n\nTherefore, $a + b^2 = -5/2 + (sqrt(7)/2)^2 = -5/2 + 7/4 = -10/4 + 7/4 = -3/4 $.",
