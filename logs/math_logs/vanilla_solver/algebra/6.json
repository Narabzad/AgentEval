  "solution": "If these two graphs intersect then the points of intersection occur when  \\[x^2+a=ax,\\] or  \\[x^2-ax+a=0.\\] This quadratic has solutions exactly when the discriminant is nonnegative: \\[(-a)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot a\\geq0.\\] This simplifies to  \\[a(a-4)\\geq0.\\] This quadratic (in $a$) is nonnegative when $a$ and $a-4$ are either both $\\ge 0$ or both $\\le 0$. This is true for $a$ in $$(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty).$$ Therefore the line and quadratic intersect exactly when $a$ is in $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty)}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The graphs of the equations $y = x^2 + a$ and $y = ax$ will intersect wherever $x^2 + a = ax$, that is, where the x-coordinates are the same. To find these points, we can subtract $ax$ from both sides to obtain:\n$x^2 - ax + a = 0$\n\nThis equation is a quadratic, and it will have real roots if and only if the discriminant is greater than or equal to zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $b^2 - 4ac$. In this case, a = 1, b = -a and c = a. Hence:\n\n$(-a)^2 - 4(1)(a) = a^2 - 4a \\geq 0$\n\nSolving this quadratic inequality will give us the possible values of a. Let's organize it:\n\n$a^2 - 4a = 0$\n\n$a(a - 4) = 0$\n\nFrom which we have either a = 0 or a = 4. Since we want $a^2 - 4a \\geq 0$, we could plot the inequality and find out the interval for a. However another approach would be to analyze the sign of the interval. \n\nFor a < 0, the inequality is positive.\nFor 0 < a < 4, the inequality is negative.\nFor a > 4, the inequality is positive again.\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is a \u2264 0 or a \u2265 4.\n\nIn interval notation, this is $a \\in (-\\infty, 0] \\cup [4, \\infty)$.",
