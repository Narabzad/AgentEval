  "solution": "The messy parts of the functions are irrelevant. All that matters for intersection is whether $f(x)-g(x)=0$. As $g(x)-f(x)=x^3-5x^2-8x+12=(x-6)(x+2)(x-1)$, the largest value of $x$ at which the graphs intersect is $x=\\boxed{6}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "Looking at the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, they are almost identical except for their respective polynomial parts:\n\nFor $f(x)$, the polynomial part is $72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1$, \nand for $g(x)$, the polynomial part is $72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$.\n\nTherefore, we can find the intersection of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by setting these polynomial parts equal to each other and solving for $x$:\n\n$72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1 = 72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$\n\nBy simplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x = 12$\n\nThis cubic equation doesn't have a simple solution using standard methods and will probably require numerical methods. However, without specific knowledge of the function behavior, a numerical solution for the largest $x$ is not immediately feasible without further tools or information.\n\nBeyond this point, you might find a numerical estimation with the help of a mathematical software, such as Wolfram Mathematica. Please note that the presence of floor functions and factorial within these functions might introduce discontinuities at integer points, making it more difficult to find a precise analytical solution.",
