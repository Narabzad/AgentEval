  "solution": "To begin, we can combine all of these square roots into a single square root: $$\\frac{\\sqrt{160}}{\\sqrt{252}}\\times\\frac{\\sqrt{245}}{\\sqrt{108}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{160}{252}}\\times\\sqrt{\\frac{245}{108}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{160\\cdot245}{252\\cdot108}}$$Now, simplify under the square root by canceling common factors.  To start, 160 and 108 are both divisible by 4.  252 and 160 also share a factor of 4.  This leaves us with: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{10\\cdot245}{63\\cdot27}}$$Looking carefully, we can see that 63 and 245 both share a factor of 7.  Cancel this, and simplify: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{10\\cdot35}{9\\cdot27}}=\\frac{5}{9}\\sqrt{\\frac{14}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{42}}{27}}$$",

  "response_with_ans": "The general strategy in this kind of problems is to first simplify each of the individual square root terms, and then cancel out common factors in the numerator and denominator.\n\nFirstly, we can write each of these square roots separately:\n$$\\sqrt{160} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 10} = \\sqrt{4^2 \\times 2 \\times 5} = 4\\sqrt{10},$$\n$$\\sqrt{252} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 63} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 9 \\times 7} = 2\\sqrt{63},$$\n$$\\sqrt{245} = \\sqrt{49 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{7^2 \\times 5} = 7\\sqrt{5},$$\n$$\\sqrt{108} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 3} = \\sqrt{6^2 \\times 3} = 6\\sqrt{3}.$$\n\nSubstituting these back into the original fraction, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{4\\sqrt{10}}{2\\sqrt{63}}\\times\\frac{7\\sqrt{5}}{6\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{63}}\\times\\frac{7\\sqrt{5}}{3\\sqrt{3}}.$$\n\nSimplifying further by multiplying the separate fractions:\n$$\\frac{2\\sqrt{10}\\times 7\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{63}\\times 3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{14\\sqrt{50}}{3\\sqrt{189}} =  \\frac{14 \\times 5\\sqrt{2}}{3 \\times 7\\sqrt{27}} = 2\\sqrt{2}.$$\n\nSo the simplified and rationalized form of the given expression is $2\\sqrt{2}.$",
