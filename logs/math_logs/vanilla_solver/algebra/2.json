  "problem": "Tina the tourist goes on a trip. She starts at the origin and drives north (in the positive $y$ direction) for $10$ units. Then she turns east (the positive $x$ direction) and as she's turning her camera flies out the window and lands exactly at $(0,10)$. She then drives $9$ units east, turns and drives $8$ units north.  She continues this pattern of turning and driving one unit less than after the previous turn, until stopping after driving $1$ unit east. She reaches for her camera only to find it missing! She activates the GPS homing device on her camera and drives back to it in a straight line. What is the equation of this line? Express your answer as $ax+by=c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, $a>0$, and $a$ is as small as possible.",

  "solution": "We know one point on the line: the camera is at $(0,10)$. To find another point on the line we can determine where Tina was when she noticed her camera was missing. She travels a total of $10+8+6+4+2$ units north from the origin, so her ending $y$-coordinate is $30$. She travels $9+7+5+3+1$ units east, so her ending $x$-coordinate is $25$. So we must find the equation of the line through $(0,10)$ and $(25,30)$. The slope of the line is $\\frac{30-10}{25-0}=\\frac{20}{25}=\\frac{4}{5}$. We can use point-slope form to find that the equation of the line is $(y-10)=\\frac{4}{5}(x-0)$, or $5(y-10)=4x$. Simplifying this gives $5y-50=4x$, so in the form requested, $\\boxed{4x-5y=-50}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "Let's summarize and represent the path that Tina takes in points.\n\nStarting from $(0,0)$, she first moves north by 10 units $(0,10)$, then 9 units east $(9,10)$, 8 units north $(9,18)$, 7 units east $(16,18)$, and so forth, until she ends at a final point $(45,45)$ after driving $1$ unit east. \n\nTo find the line between the point where she lost her camera $(0,10)$ and the final point $(45,45)$, we need to calculate the slope, which is defined as $m = (y_2-y_1) / (x_2-x_1)$. Substituting coordinates of these two points into this equation we find:\n\n$m = (45-10) / (45-0) = 35/45 = 7/9$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y = (7/9)x + b$. To find intercept $b$, we can use the coordinates of the point where Tina loses her camera $(0,10)$:\n\n$10 = (7/9)*0 + b$,\n$b = 10$.\n\nSo, the equation of Tina's path back to her camera becomes $y = (7/9)x + 10$.\n\nTo put this equation into standard form ($ax + by = c$), we can multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n$9y = 7x + 90$.\n\nFinally, we switch the order to match the desired format, making sure that the coefficient on $x$ is positive: \n\n$7x - 9y = -90$.\n\nThis is standard form, but we want $c$ to be positive, so we multiply through by $-1$ to get \n\n$-7x + 9y = 90$.\n\nSo, the desired answer is $\\boxed{-7x + 9y = 90}$.\n",
