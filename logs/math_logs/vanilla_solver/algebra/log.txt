Problem 0 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: (-\infty, -14)\cup(-3,\infty)

Reply: To solve the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we first simplify and solve for $x$ as if it were an equation. 

$(2x+10)(x+3) = (3x+9)(x+8)$

Multiplying through the parentheses, we get:

$2x^2+30x+30 = 3x^2+33x+72$

Rearranging to get all terms on one side, we get:

$x^2+3x-42 = 0$

This can be factored to:

$(x-6)(x+7) = 0$

So, $x = 6, -7$ are the solutions to the corresponding equation. 

However, because the inequality has a "<" sign, we need to test values of $x$ in each of the intervals formed by $x = -7$ and $x = 6$ to see where the inequality is satisfied.

1. Test a value less than $-7$, such as $x = -8$: 
   
    $(2*-8+10)*(-8+3) = -50$
   
    $(3*-8+9)*(-8+8) = 0$

    Since $-50 < 0$, the inequality is true for $x < -7$.
   
2. Test a value between $-7$ and $6$, such as $x = 0: 

   $(2*0+10)*(0+3) = 30$
   
   $(3*0+9)*(0+8) = 72$

   Since $30 < 72$, the inequality is true for $-7 < x < 6$.

3. Test a value greater than $6$, such as $x = 7$:

   $(2*7+10)*(7+3) = 270$
   
   $(3*7+9)*(7+8) = 378$

   Since $270 < 378$, the inequality is not satisfied for $x > 6$.
   
Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $x$ in the open interval $(-\infty,-7]$ and $(-7, 6)$. In interval notation, the solution can be written as:

$x \in (-\infty,-7] \cup (-7, 6)$.

Problem 1 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 93

Reply: In an arithmetic progression, the nth term $a_n$ can be written as $a_0 +(n-1)d$, where $a_0$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference, which in this case is 1.

Consequently, the sum of the first 98 terms in an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula:
\(\frac{n}{2}[2a_0 + (n-1)d]\)
which simplifies here into 
\[n/2(2a_1 + (n-1)) =137.\]

Given, $n = 98, d = 1$
Substituting these values in, we get
\[98/2(2a_1 + 97) = 137\],
which reduces to
\[49(2a_1 + 97) = 137\],
giving
\[2a_1 + 97 = 137/49\],
which simplifies to
\[2a_1 = 137/49 - 97 = -60/49\].

Finally, then
\[a_1 = -60/(2*49) = -60/98 = -30/49.\]

Now, to find the sum of the even-indexed terms, we essentially find the sum of the terms of another arithmetic sequence with first term $a_2$ and same common difference, but this time $n = 49$.
We know $a_2 = a_1 + d = -30/49 + 1 = 19/49$.
Substituting this in the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression gives
\(\frac{n}{2}[2a_0 + (n-1)d]\), or
49/2(2*19/49 + 48), which simplifies to
\[49/2(38/49 + 48) = 49(86/49)/2 = 43.\]

Therefore, the value of $a_2+a_4+a_6+a_8+\dots+a_{98}$ is 43.

Problem 2 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 4x-5y=-50

Reply: Let's summarize and represent the path that Tina takes in points.

Starting from $(0,0)$, she first moves north by 10 units $(0,10)$, then 9 units east $(9,10)$, 8 units north $(9,18)$, 7 units east $(16,18)$, and so forth, until she ends at a final point $(45,45)$ after driving $1$ unit east. 

To find the line between the point where she lost her camera $(0,10)$ and the final point $(45,45)$, we need to calculate the slope, which is defined as $m = (y_2-y_1) / (x_2-x_1)$. Substituting coordinates of these two points into this equation we find:

$m = (45-10) / (45-0) = 35/45 = 7/9$.

Therefore, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y = (7/9)x + b$. To find intercept $b$, we can use the coordinates of the point where Tina loses her camera $(0,10)$:

$10 = (7/9)*0 + b$,
$b = 10$.

So, the equation of Tina's path back to her camera becomes $y = (7/9)x + 10$.

To put this equation into standard form ($ax + by = c$), we can multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fraction:

$9y = 7x + 90$.

Finally, we switch the order to match the desired format, making sure that the coefficient on $x$ is positive: 

$7x - 9y = -90$.

This is standard form, but we want $c$ to be positive, so we multiply through by $-1$ to get 

$-7x + 9y = 90$.

So, the desired answer is $\boxed{-7x + 9y = 90}$.

Problem 3 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: -5

Reply: We can find the values of values of $x$ that satisfy both equations by setting them equal to each other:
$$2x^2 +kx +6 = -x +4 .$$

This simplifies to the quadratic equation:
$$2x^2 + (k+1)x +2 = 0.$$ 

A quadratic equation $ax^2 +bx +c = 0$ has exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant is equal to zero. The discriminant is given by the formula $b^2 - 4ac$.

So we set discriminant equals to 0 and get:

$$(k+1)^2 -4*2*2 = 0 .$$

This simplifies to:

$$k^2 +2k +1 -16 = 0 .$$

Further simplification results in:

$$k^2 +2k -15 = 0 .$$

Factoring this, we get:

$$(k-3)(k+5) = 0. $$

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions $k=3$ and $k=-5$. 

Since we're asked for the negative value of k, the final solution will be $k = -5$.

Problem 4 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 12, 10, 6

Reply: The roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 7x + c = 0$ are real and rational if and only if its discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$, is non-negative and a perfect square.

In this case, the discriminant is $(-7)^2 - 4*1*c = 49 - 4c$.

For the discriminant to be nonnegative, we need
$49 - 4c \geq 0$
$\Rightarrow 4c \leq 49$
$\Rightarrow c \leq 12.25$

Since $c$ is a positive integer, the largest value of $c$ is $12$.

We need to list down the values of $c$ for which the discriminant is a perfect square. The perfect squares less than or equal to $49$ are $0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49$. 

So $49 - 4c$ has to be one of these values. 

Considering each perfect square in descending order:

$c = 0$ for the perfect square $49$. But $c$ is a positive integer, so $c = 0$ is rejected.

$c = 6$ for the perfect square $25$. The value $c = 6$ is acceptable.

$c = 8$ for the perfect square $16$. The value $c = 8$ is acceptable.

$c = 10$ for the perfect square $9$. The value $c = 10$ is acceptable.

$c = 11$ for the perfect square $4$. The value $c = 11$ is acceptable.

$c = 12$ for the perfect square $1$. The value $c = 12$ is acceptable.

For the perfect square $0$, we get $c = 12.25$, which is not an integer and thus rejected.

Hence, the admissible values for $c$ in decreasing order are $12, 11, 10, 8, 6$.

Problem 5 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 2

Reply: We can first simplify this expression:

$\frac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1} = 3x - 2 + \frac{-1}{x - 1}$

Now, it is clear that the only limitation on $m$ is caused by the term $\frac{-1}{x - 1}$, which can have any real value except $0$. Therefore, the values that $m$ cannot have are any value equal to $3x - 2$, since this is the value it always takes regardless of the second term.

However, since $x$ can be any real number except $1$, there is no specific real value that $m$ cannot have, because $3x - 2$ can take on any real value. 

So the answer is no real values are excluded from possible values for $m$.

Problem 6 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: (-\infty,0]\cup[4,\infty)

Reply: The graphs of the equations $y = x^2 + a$ and $y = ax$ will intersect wherever $x^2 + a = ax$, that is, where the x-coordinates are the same. To find these points, we can subtract $ax$ from both sides to obtain:
$x^2 - ax + a = 0$

This equation is a quadratic, and it will have real roots if and only if the discriminant is greater than or equal to zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $b^2 - 4ac$. In this case, a = 1, b = -a and c = a. Hence:

$(-a)^2 - 4(1)(a) = a^2 - 4a \geq 0$

Solving this quadratic inequality will give us the possible values of a. Let's organize it:

$a^2 - 4a = 0$

$a(a - 4) = 0$

From which we have either a = 0 or a = 4. Since we want $a^2 - 4a \geq 0$, we could plot the inequality and find out the interval for a. However another approach would be to analyze the sign of the interval. 

For a < 0, the inequality is positive.
For 0 < a < 4, the inequality is negative.
For a > 4, the inequality is positive again.

So, the solution to the inequality is a ≤ 0 or a ≥ 4.

In interval notation, this is $a \in (-\infty, 0] \cup [4, \infty)$.

Problem 7 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: -\dfrac{3}{4}

Reply: We can solve this equation by using the quadratic formula: 

$x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a$

This gives: 

$x = [-5 ± sqrt((5^2) - 4*1*8)] / 2*1$
$x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 - 32)] / 2$
$x = [-5 ± sqrt(-7)] / 2$

We can then see that the square root of -7 is a complex number, and we can write it as the imaginary i times the square root of 7 because: 

sqrt(-1) = i, so sqrt(-7) = sqrt(7) * i

Therefore we have:

$x = -5/2 ± sqrt(7)/2 * i$

Comparing this to the form $x = a + bi$ shows that $a = -5/2$ and $b = sqrt(7)/2$. 

Therefore, $a + b^2 = -5/2 + (sqrt(7)/2)^2 = -5/2 + 7/4 = -10/4 + 7/4 = -3/4 $.

Reply: The graph appears to have a vertical asymptote at $x=2$. From the given equation, vertical asymptote happens where $Bx + C = 0$. Therefore, $B\cdot2 + C = 0$ which implies that $B=-C$.

Also, the graph appears to have a horizontal asymptote at $y=-1$. From the given equation, the horizontal asymptote will be when $\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{x + A}{Bx + C} = -1$. This indicates that $A$ must be equal to $-B$.

Because $A=-B$ and $B=-C$, we have that $A=B=C$. 

Using the horizontal asymptote, we get that $y=\frac{x-1}{x-1} = 1$. Therefore, $A=B=C=1$.

Problem 9 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 4

Reply: The first transformation, shifting the parabola 1 unit to the right, changes the equation of the parabola to $y = - (x)^2 + 1$. 

The second transformation, shifting the parabola 5 units down, changes the equation to $y = - (x)^2 - 4$.

Lastly, rotating the parabola 180 degrees about its vertex does not change the position of the x-intercepts, only flips the parabola about its vertex. So the equation is still $y = - (x)^2 - 4$.

Setting $y = 0$, we get $0 = - (x)^2 - 4$ => $x^2 = -4$, which has no real solutions. 

This means the parabola never intersects the x-axis, so $a=b$. Therefore, $b-a=0$.

Reply: Looking at the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, they are almost identical except for their respective polynomial parts:

For $f(x)$, the polynomial part is $72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1$, 
and for $g(x)$, the polynomial part is $72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$.

Therefore, we can find the intersection of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by setting these polynomial parts equal to each other and solving for $x$:

$72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1 = 72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$

By simplifying this equation, we get:

$x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x = 12$

This cubic equation doesn't have a simple solution using standard methods and will probably require numerical methods. However, without specific knowledge of the function behavior, a numerical solution for the largest $x$ is not immediately feasible without further tools or information.

- For $\displaystyle{f(-2)}$, since $\displaystyle{-2^{(-2+1)}}$ equals 1 when `x+1` is not equal to zero; and here, `x+1` equals -1, so we have $\displaystyle{-2^{(-2+1)}=(-2)^{-1} = -0.5}$. Also, $\displaystyle{0^{(-2+3)}=0^1=0}$. Therefore, $\displaystyle{f(-2)=-0.5*0=0}$.

Problem 12 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 7

Reply: First, let's find the midpoint of the points $(1,2)$ and $(19,4)$, which is also a point on line $l$. 

Midpoint formula is $\left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$, so the midpoint is $\left(\frac{1+19}{2}, \frac{2+4}{2}\right) = (10,3)$

The slope of the line passing through $(0,7)$ and $(4,-3)$ can be found using the slope formula:

$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-3 - 7}{4 - 0} = \frac{-10}{4} = -\frac{5}{2}$

A line perpendicular to this will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of this slope. This is calculated as $-\frac{1}{m}$. In this case, the slope of line $l$, $m_l$, is the negative reciprocal of $-\frac{5}{2}$, which is $\frac{2}{5}$.

The equation for line $l$ in point slope form is $y - y_1 = m_l (x - x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line. Using $(10,3)$ as the point and $\frac{2}{5}$ as the slope, the equation for line $l$ is: 

$y - 3 = \frac{2}{5}(x - 10)$

We want the $y$-coordinate of the point where $x = 20$. Substitute $x = 20$ into this equation:

$y - 3 = \frac{2}{5} (20 - 10)$

$y - 3 = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 10$

$y = 3 + 4 = 7$

Hence, the $y$-coordinate we are looking for is $7$.

Reply: To find the function k(x) such that f(x) is its own inverse function, we need to solve for k(x) such that f(f(x)) = x.

Consider x > 0. For f(x) to be its own inverse, we must have f(f(x)) = x. This means that f(k(x)) must equal x for x > 0.

So we want to solve k(k(x)) = x.

But we must also ensure that k(x) is consistent with the given definition of f(x) for x < 0 and x = 0, i.e., k(x) must equal -1/(2x) for x < 0 and 0 for x = 0.

However, we have a contradiction here because the function k(x) = -1/(2x) is not defined for x > 0, and the function k(x) meeting the condition k(k(x)) = x for x > 0 doesn't necessarily meet the condition k(x) = 0 for x = 0.

Thus, such a function k(x) does not exist such that f(x) is its own inverse.

Problem 17 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \frac{5\sqrt{42}}{27}

Reply: The general strategy in this kind of problems is to first simplify each of the individual square root terms, and then cancel out common factors in the numerator and denominator.

Firstly, we can write each of these square roots separately:
$$\sqrt{160} = \sqrt{16 \times 10} = \sqrt{4^2 \times 2 \times 5} = 4\sqrt{10},$$
$$\sqrt{252} = \sqrt{4 \times 63} = \sqrt{2^2 \times 9 \times 7} = 2\sqrt{63},$$
$$\sqrt{245} = \sqrt{49 \times 5} = \sqrt{7^2 \times 5} = 7\sqrt{5},$$
$$\sqrt{108} = \sqrt{36 \times 3} = \sqrt{6^2 \times 3} = 6\sqrt{3}.$$

Substituting these back into the original fraction, we get:

$$\frac{4\sqrt{10}}{2\sqrt{63}}\times\frac{7\sqrt{5}}{6\sqrt{3}}=\frac{2\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt{63}}\times\frac{7\sqrt{5}}{3\sqrt{3}}.$$

Simplifying further by multiplying the separate fractions:
$$\frac{2\sqrt{10}\times 7\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{63}\times 3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{14\sqrt{50}}{3\sqrt{189}} =  \frac{14 \times 5\sqrt{2}}{3 \times 7\sqrt{27}} = 2\sqrt{2}.$$

So the simplified and rationalized form of the given expression is $2\sqrt{2}.$

however, the ground truth answer is $\frac{5\sqrt{42}}{27}$.

the two answers are not the same conceptually or numerically. the provided solution in the reply seems to be miscalculated, as the result doesn't match the ground truth answer.

therefore, "the answer is incorrect. correct answer: $\frac{5\sqrt{42}}{27}$ | answer extracted: $2\sqrt{2}.$"

Problem 18 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: \sqrt{10}

Reply: First, we need to find the intersections of the two functions, $y = x^2$ and $y = 1 - x$.

Setting $x^2 = 1 - x$, we get a quadratic equation:

$x^2 + x - 1 = 0$

This can be solved using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b  ± \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -1. 

This gives:

$x = \frac{-1  ± \sqrt{(1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}$
$x = \frac{-1  ± \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2}$
$x = \frac{-1  ± \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

This gives us two solutions, $x_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $x_2 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Substitute these into the equation $y = x^2$ we get two corresponding $y_1$ and $y_2$. They are $y_1 = (\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2$ and $y_2 = (\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^2$.

Therefore, the two intersection points are $(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, (\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2)$ and $(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, (\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^2)$.

Then we can calculate the distance between these two points using the distance formula. The distance d between two points $P1(x_1, y_1)$ and $P2(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula: 
$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

Substitute the two points into the distance formula, we get:

$d = \sqrt{((\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}) - (\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}))^2 + ((\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 - (\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2)^2}$

Further calculation ends up with:

$d = \sqrt{(\sqrt{5})^2 + ((\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 - (\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2)^2}$

The equation above is the final form of distance between the two intersections of $y=x^2$ and $x + y = 1$.

Problem 19 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: \$18.90

Reply: Let's denote the cost per unit of surface area as $a$ and the cost per unit of volume as $v$. The surface area $S$ of a cube with side length $d$ is $6d^2$ and the volume $V$ is $d^3$.

We can therefore express the total cost $c$ of a cube with side length $d$ as follows:

$C = aS + vV = a6d^2 + vd^3$

Now we can establish two equations based on the information we have about the 1 inch and 2 inch cubes:

For 1 inch cube:

$1.30 = 6a + v$

For 2 inch cube:

$6.80 = 24a + 8v$

From here, we can solve this linear system for the variables $a$ and $v$. Subtracting the first equation from the second one gives:

$5.50 = 18a + 7v$

Now we can express $v$ in terms of $a$ from the first equation:

$v = 1.30 - 6a$

Substitute $v$ into the equation involving $v$ and $a$:

$5.50 = 18a + 7(1.30 - 6a)$

Which simplifies to:

$5.50 = 18a + 9.1 - 42a$

By organizing it, we obtain:

$a = \frac{9.1 - 5.5}{42 - 18} = \frac{3.6}{24} = 0.15$

Substitute $a$ into the first equation to find $v$:

$v = 1.30 - 6(0.15) = 1.30 - 0.90 = 0.40$

Now we know that the cost per unit of surface area is $0.15 and the cost per unit of volume is $0.40.

We can calculate the cost of a 3 inch cube:

$C = 6a(3^2) + v(3^3) = 6(0.15)(9) + 0.40(27) = 8.10 + 10.80 = $18.90.
