  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Algebra",
  "solution": "We notice that the numerator of the fraction factors into $(3x-1)(x-1)$. Substituting this into the given expression, we get $m=\\dfrac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1} = \\dfrac{(3x-1)(x-1)}{x-1}$. This simplifies to $m=3x-1$ if $x$ is not 1. Thus, $m$ can be any real number except for the value it takes when $x$ is $1.$ This value is $3(1)-1=3-1=\\boxed{2}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "We can first simplify this expression:\n\n$\\frac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1} = 3x - 2 + \\frac{-1}{x - 1}$\n\nNow, it is clear that the only limitation on $m$ is caused by the term $\\frac{-1}{x - 1}$, which can have any real value except $0$. Therefore, the values that $m$ cannot have are any value equal to $3x - 2$, since this is the value it always takes regardless of the second term.\n\nHowever, since $x$ can be any real number except $1$, there is no specific real value that $m$ cannot have, because $3x - 2$ can take on any real value. \n\nSo the answer is no real values are excluded from possible values for $m$.",
