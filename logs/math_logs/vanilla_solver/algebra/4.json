  "type": "Algebra",
  "solution": "For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 7x + c = 0$ are real and rational if and only if its discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$, is non-negative and a perfect square.\n\nIn this case, the discriminant is $(-7)^2 - 4*1*c = 49 - 4c$.\n\nFor the discriminant to be nonnegative, we need\n$49 - 4c \\geq 0$\n$\\Rightarrow 4c \\leq 49$\n$\\Rightarrow c \\leq 12.25$\n\nSince $c$ is a positive integer, the largest value of $c$ is $12$.\n\nWe need to list down the values of $c$ for which the discriminant is a perfect square. The perfect squares less than or equal to $49$ are $0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49$. \n\nSo $49 - 4c$ has to be one of these values. \n\nConsidering each perfect square in descending order:\n\n$c = 0$ for the perfect square $49$. But $c$ is a positive integer, so $c = 0$ is rejected.\n\n$c = 6$ for the perfect square $25$. The value $c = 6$ is acceptable.\n\n$c = 8$ for the perfect square $16$. The value $c = 8$ is acceptable.\n\n$c = 10$ for the perfect square $9$. The value $c = 10$ is acceptable.\n\n$c = 11$ for the perfect square $4$. The value $c = 11$ is acceptable.\n\n$c = 12$ for the perfect square $1$. The value $c = 12$ is acceptable.\n\nFor the perfect square $0$, we get $c = 12.25$, which is not an integer and thus rejected.\n\nHence, the admissible values for $c$ in decreasing order are $12, 11, 10, 8, 6$.",
