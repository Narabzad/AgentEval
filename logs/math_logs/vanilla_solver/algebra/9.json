Shifting this last parabola 5 units down changes its equation to $y=-x^2-4$. Rotating it by 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=x^2-4$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=x^2-4$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=x^2-4$. Factoring the right hand side, we get $0=(x-2)(x+2)$, so either $x-2=0\\Rightarrow x=2$ or $x+2=0 \\Rightarrow x=-2$. Thus, $a=-2$ and $b=2$, so $b-a=\\boxed{4}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "The first transformation, shifting the parabola 1 unit to the right, changes the equation of the parabola to $y = - (x)^2 + 1$. \n\nThe second transformation, shifting the parabola 5 units down, changes the equation to $y = - (x)^2 - 4$.\n\nLastly, rotating the parabola 180 degrees about its vertex does not change the position of the x-intercepts, only flips the parabola about its vertex. So the equation is still $y = - (x)^2 - 4$.\n\nSetting $y = 0$, we get $0 = - (x)^2 - 4$ => $x^2 = -4$, which has no real solutions. \n\nThis means the parabola never intersects the x-axis, so $a=b$. Therefore, $b-a=0$.\n",
