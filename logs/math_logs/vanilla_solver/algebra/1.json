  "solution": "Let $S = a_1 + a_3 + \\dots + a_{97}$ and $T = a_2 + a_4 + \\dots + a_{98}$. Then the given equation states that $S + T = 137$, and we want to find $T$.\n\nWe can build another equation relating $S$ and $T$: note that \\[\\begin{aligned} T-S &= (a_2-a_1) + (a_4-a_3) + \\dots + (a_{98}-a_{97}) \\\\ &= \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\dots + 1}_{49 \\text{ times }} \\\\ &= 49 \\end{aligned}\\]since $(a_n)$ has common difference $1$. Then, adding the two equations $S+T=137$ and $T-S=49$, we get $2T=137+49=186$, so $T = \\tfrac{186}{2} = \\boxed{93}$.",

  "response_with_ans": "In an arithmetic progression, the nth term $a_n$ can be written as $a_0 +(n-1)d$, where $a_0$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference, which in this case is 1.\n\nConsequently, the sum of the first 98 terms in an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula:\n\\(\\frac{n}{2}[2a_0 + (n-1)d]\\)\nwhich simplifies here into \n\\[n/2(2a_1 + (n-1)) =137.\\]\n\nGiven, $n = 98, d = 1$\nSubstituting these values in, we get\n\\[98/2(2a_1 + 97) = 137\\],\nwhich reduces to\n\\[49(2a_1 + 97) = 137\\],\ngiving\n\\[2a_1 + 97 = 137/49\\],\nwhich simplifies to\n\\[2a_1 = 137/49 - 97 = -60/49\\].\n\nFinally, then\n\\[a_1 = -60/(2*49) = -60/98 = -30/49.\\]\n\nNow, to find the sum of the even-indexed terms, we essentially find the sum of the terms of another arithmetic sequence with first term $a_2$ and same common difference, but this time $n = 49$.\nWe know $a_2 = a_1 + d = -30/49 + 1 = 19/49$.\nSubstituting this in the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression gives\n\\(\\frac{n}{2}[2a_0 + (n-1)d]\\), or\n49/2(2*19/49 + 48), which simplifies to\n\\[49/2(38/49 + 48) = 49(86/49)/2 = 43.\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $a_2+a_4+a_6+a_8+\\dots+a_{98}$ is 43.",
