  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls. First, we pick which 3 of the 5 rolls are 1 or 2: we can do that in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways.  Now for each of these 3 rolls, there are 2 choices, and for each of the other 2 rolls, there are 4 choices.  Thus the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}2^34^2}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}.\\]",

    "This is a binomial probability question and can be solved using the binomial probability formula:\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case:\n- n (number of trials) is 5 (the number of dice rolls)\n- k (number of successes) is 3 (we want exactly 3 rolls to be a 1 or a 2)\n- p (probability of success on a single trial) is 1/3 (the probability that a single dice roll is a 1 or a 2)\n\nWe can use Python's math library to calculate the combinations and the probability.\nPython's math.comb function can be used to calculate combinations and simple arithmetic can be used for the rest of the formula. \n\nLet's calculate the probability. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# variables\nn = 5  # number of trials\nk = 3  # number of successes\np = 1/3  # probability of success on a single trial\n\n# calculate combinations\ncombinations = math.comb(n, k)\n\n# calculate probability\nprobability = combinations * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(n-k))\nprobability\n```\n\n"
