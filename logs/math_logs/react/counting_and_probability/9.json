  "problem": "Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?\n\nNote that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second car turning left. In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.",

  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.",

    "The number of ways the cars can stack up is equivalent to the number of permutations of the six cars across three lanes, with at least one car in each lane. \n\nThis problem can be broken down into two parts:\n1. Distributing the cars into the lanes in such a way that each lane has at least one car.\n2. Arranging the cars within the lanes.\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method for the first part, and permutations for the second part. \n\nThe stars and bars method is a combinatorical method used to solve the problem of distributing n identical items into k bins. Here, our 'stars' are the cars and our 'bins' are the lanes. Since we need at least one car in each lane, we first put one car in each lane, leaving us with 3 cars to distribute. The number of ways to distribute these remaining cars is \"n+k-1 choose k-1\" = \"3+3-1 choose 3-1\" = \"5 choose 2\".\n\nAfter distributing the cars, we need to arrange them within the lanes. Since each lane can have 0 to 3 cars, and the cars within the lanes are distinguishable, we can use the permutation formula \"n!\" to calculate the number of ways to arrange the cars in each lane, and then multiply these numbers together.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can use Python's built-in functions for combinations and factorials. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate combinations for stars and bars\ncomb = math.comb(5, 2)\n\n# Calculate permutations for each possible number of cars in a lane\nperms = [math.factorial(i) for i in range(4)]\n\n# Calculate total number of ways\ntotal_ways = 0\nfor i in range(4):\n    for j in range(4):\n        for k in range(4):\n            if i + j + k == 3:\n                total_ways += comb * perms[i] * perms[j] * perms[k]\n\nprint(total_ways)\n```\n310\n"
