  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "Each card has an equal likelihood of being either on top of the jokers, in between them, or below the jokers.  Thus, on average, $1/3$ of them will land between the two jokers. Multiplying this by the 52 yields our answer of $\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}$.",

    "We know that there are 54 cards in total. If we consider the positions of the two jokers in the shuffled deck, there are 54 possible positions for the first joker and 53 for the second, which gives 54*53 total possibilities. \n\nIf we consider a deck without the two jokers, there are 52 cards. Any number of these 52 cards (0 through 52) can be strictly between the two jokers. If we consider the number of ways for each scenario, we can see that it's a combination problem. The number of ways to choose k cards out of 52 to be between the jokers is given by the binomial coefficient, \"52 choose k\". \n\nFor each k (0 through 52), we calculate the product of (1) the number of ways to choose k cards out of 52 to be between the jokers, (2) the number of ways to arrange the chosen k cards and the two jokers (which is (k+2) ways for the jokers and k! ways for the chosen cards), and (3) the number of ways to arrange the remaining cards (which is (52-k)!). This gives the total number of favorable outcomes for each k.\n\nWe then add up the products for all k, divide by the total number of possibilities, and multiply by k. This will give us the expected number of cards between the jokers.\n\nWe can implement this calculation using Python. We'll use the math library for the factorial and comb function. \n\nLet's write the code. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\ntotal_possibilities = 54 * 53\nexpected_value = 0\n\nfor k in range(53):\n    # number of ways to choose k cards out of 52 to be between the jokers\n    choose_ways = math.comb(52, k)\n    # number of ways to arrange the chosen k cards and the two jokers\n    arrange_ways = math.factorial(k+2) * math.factorial(52-k)\n    # total number of favorable outcomes for k\n    favorable_outcomes = choose_ways * arrange_ways\n    # add the product for k to the expected value\n    expected_value += k * favorable_outcomes / total_possibilities\n\nexpected_value\n```\n\n"
