  "problem": "Ten people are sitting around a round table.  Three of them are chosen at random to give a presentation.  What is the probability that the three chosen people were sitting in consecutive seats?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "Let's count as our outcomes the ways to select 3 people without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways to select any 3 people.  The number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to select 3 consecutive people.  There are only 10 ways to do this -- think of first selecting the middle person, then we take his or her two neighbors.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{120} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$.",

    "To solve this problem, I need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 10 and the total number of ways to choose 3 consecutive people out of 10. The probability will be the ratio of these two quantities. \n\nI can calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 10 using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of people, k is the number of people to choose, and ! denotes factorial. \n\nI can calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 consecutive people out of 10 in a round table by simply considering each person as a starting point for a group of 3, so there are 10 ways. \n\nAfter calculating these two quantities, I can find the probability by dividing the number of ways to choose 3 consecutive people by the total number of ways to choose 3 people. \n\nI'll use Python's math library to calculate the factorials and the combinations. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of people\nn = 10\n\n# Number of people to choose\nk = 3\n\n# Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 10\ntotal_ways = math.comb(n, k)\n\n# Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 consecutive people out of 10\nconsecutive_ways = n\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = consecutive_ways / total_ways\nprobability\n```\n"
