  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$.",

    "In order to solve this problem, I need to calculate the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers out of 6 total peppers. This is equivalent to the sum of the probabilities of selecting exactly 4, 5, and 6 green peppers.\n\nThe probability of selecting exactly k green peppers is given by the binomial coefficient \"15 choose k\" times \"10 choose (6-k)\", divided by \"15 choose 6\". This is because there are \"15 choose k\" ways to select k green peppers out of 15, and for each of these possibilities, there are \"10 choose (6-k)\" ways to select the remaining peppers from the red ones. The total number of ways to select 6 peppers out of 15 is \"15 choose 6\".\n\nThe binomial coefficient \"n choose k\" is given by the formula n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n! denotes the factorial of n. I can use the factorial function from the math module in Python to calculate this.\n\nFirst, I will define a function to calculate the binomial coefficient, then I will calculate the sum of the probabilities for k = 4, 5, and 6. Since we want a common fraction as the answer, I will use the fractions module to represent the result as a fraction.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
