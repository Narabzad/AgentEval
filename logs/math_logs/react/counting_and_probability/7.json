However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ such $n$.",
