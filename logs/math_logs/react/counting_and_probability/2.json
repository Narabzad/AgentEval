  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.  So the answer is \\[1-2\\frac{\\binom{26}{3}}{\\binom{52}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}.\\]",

    "This is a problem of probability and combinatorics. The total number of ways to draw 3 cards from a deck of 52 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and '!' denotes factorial. This will give us the denominator for our probability calculation.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 3 cards that are not all the same color is a bit more complex. We can break this down into two cases: the case where we draw 2 cards of one color and 1 card of another color, and the case where we draw 1 card of one color and 2 cards of another color. For each case, we need to calculate the number of ways to draw the cards of each color, and then add the two cases together. This will give us the numerator for our probability calculation.\n\nFinally, we divide the numerator by the denominator to get the probability. \n\nLet's implement this in Python. Note that Python's math library provides a function for calculating combinations, so we can use that instead of implementing the combination formula ourselves.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
    "I will calculate the total number of ways to draw 3 cards from a deck of 52 using the combination formula. Then, I will calculate the number of ways to draw 3 cards that are not all the same color by considering the two cases separately. Finally, I will divide the latter by the former to get the probability.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate total number of ways to draw 3 cards from a deck of 52\ntotal_ways = math.comb(52, 3)\n\n# Calculate number of ways to draw 3 cards that are not all the same color\n# Case 1: 2 cards of color A, 1 card of color B\nways_case1 = math.comb(26, 2) * math.comb(26, 1)\n\n# Case 2: 1 card of color A, 2 cards of color B\nways_case2 = math.comb(26, 1) * math.comb(26, 2)\n\n# Total ways for the two cases\ntotal_ways_not_all_same_color = ways_case1 + ways_case2\n\n# Calculate probability\nprobability = total_ways_not_all_same_color / total_ways\nprobability\n```\n"
