  "problem": "A fisherman can see seven aquatic creatures in a lake --- four crocodiles, a catfish, and two giant squid. If he does not wish to fish two crocodiles consecutively, in how many orders can he catch all seven creatures? (Individuals from the same species are indistinguishable.)",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "The crocodiles must be separated from each other by one of the other creatures, so he must catch them first, third, fifth, and seventh. For the second, fourth, and sixth slots, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the remaining three creatures.\n\nHowever, there are two giant squid, so we must divide by $2!$, the number of ways to arrange the squid.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{3!}{2!}=\\boxed{3}$ ways.",

    "This problem can be solved through combinatorics. Since the individuals of the same species are indistinguishable, we can consider each species as a single entity. We need to find the number of ways to arrange these entities so that no two crocodiles appear consecutively.\n\nLet's consider the species other than crocodiles as slots. We have 3 slots: a catfish, a giant squid and another giant squid.\n\nThe crocodiles can be placed in between these slots, before the first slot and after the last slot. This gives us 4 possible places to put the crocodiles.\n\nSo, the problem becomes how to distribute 4 indistinguishable crocodiles into 4 distinguishable boxes. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and it's known as the stars and bars problem.\n\nThe solution to the stars and bars problem is given by the binomial coefficient (n+k-1 choose k), where n is the number of stars (crocodiles in this case) and k is the number of bars (slots in this case). \n\nSo the solution to our problem would be (4+4-1 choose 4) = (7 choose 4). I will calculate this using python. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# number of ways = (n+k-1 choose k)\nn = 4  # number of crocodiles\nk = 4  # number of slots\n\nways = math.comb(n+k-1, k)\n\nprint(ways)\n```\n35\n"
