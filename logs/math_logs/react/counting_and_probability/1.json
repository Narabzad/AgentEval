We now insert the 4 into the lineup, keeping in mind that it must appear to the right of the 1 and 2.  There are three possible positions in the first case and two spots in the second case, bringing the total number of orderings to five.  Finally, when placing the 5 into any one of these orderings we need only ensure that it appears to the right of the 1, so there are five possibilities for each of our five orderings, making $\\boxed{25}$ orderings in all.",

    "The problem is asking for the number of ways we can arrange the numbers 1 to 6 such that for every number, all of its divisors appear to its left. This is a combinatorics problem and can be solved using factorials. However, since the numbers 1 to 6 have divisors that are not distinct, we need to consider this when calculating the total arrangements. The number 1 has no divisors, so it must be at the beginning. The numbers 2, 3, and 5 are primes and only have 1 as a divisor, so they must come after 1 but can be in any order among themselves. The number 4 has divisors 1 and 2, so it must come after 2 but can be in any order with 3 and 5. The number 6 has divisors 1, 2, and 3, so it must come last. Therefore, there is only one way to arrange these numbers to meet the criteria.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: N/A\nNameError(\"name 'N' is not defined\")"
