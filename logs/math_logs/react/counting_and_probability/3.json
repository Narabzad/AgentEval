  "problem": "Maria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. How many ways are there for her to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges?  (Note: Maria takes none of the fruit herself, and some of her friends might not receive any fruit at all.)",
  "level": "Level 5",

  "solution": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",

    "This problem can be solved using the concept of combinatorics. The problem can be divided into two parts. First, distributing the apples and then distributing the oranges. \n\nFor the apples, since they are identical and some friends might not receive any fruit, it's equivalent to putting three indistinguishable items (apples) into four distinguishable boxes (friends). This is a classic problem of combinations with repetition, which can be solved using the formula C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of distinct items (friends) and r is the number of indistinguishable items (apples).\n\nFor the oranges, the situation is similar, but we only have three boxes (friends), because Jacky can't get any oranges. \n\nAfter we calculate the number of ways to distribute the apples and the oranges separately, we multiply these two numbers together to get the final answer, because for each way to distribute the apples, there are several ways to distribute the oranges. \n\nThe formula C(n + r - 1, r) can be implemented using the factorial function, which is defined as fact(n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1. We can use the math library in Python to calculate the factorial. \n\nSo I'll define a function to calculate the number of combinations with repetition, and then use it to calculate the number of ways to distribute the apples and the oranges. Then I'll multiply these two numbers together to get the final answer. \n\nSo I'll write a Python function to calculate the number of combinations with repetition, and then use it to calculate the answer. I'll use the math library in Python to calculate the factorial. \n\nThe formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + r - 1, r) = fact(n + r - 1) / (fact(r) * fact(n - 1)).\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
