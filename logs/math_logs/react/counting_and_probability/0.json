  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Counting & Probability",
  "solution": "There are \\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{6!\\cdot 2!} = 28\n\\]ways to choose the bills. A sum of at least $\\$20$ is obtained by choosing  both $\\$20$ bills, one of the  $\\$20$ bills and one of the six smaller bills, or both $\\$10$ bills.   Hence the probability is \\[\n\\frac{ 1 + 2\\cdot 6 + 1}{28}=\\frac{14}{28}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]",

    "Firstly, we need to calculate total number of ways to draw 2 bills from 8, and then calculate the number of ways to get a sum of $20 or more.\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 bills from 8 can be calculated using combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\nThe ways to get a sum of $20 or more are: (10, 10), (10, 20), (20, 20), (20, 10). \nWe can calculate the probability as the ratio of these two numbers. \nLet's calculate this using python. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of bills\ntotal_bills = 8\n\n# Number of bills to draw\ndraw_bills = 2\n\n# Calculate total ways to draw 2 bills from 8\ntotal_ways = math.comb(total_bills, draw_bills)\n\n# Calculate the ways to get a sum of $20 or more\n# (10, 10), (10, 20), (20, 20), (20, 10)\n# There are 2 tens and 2 twenties, so there are 2 ways to draw (10, 10), 4 ways to draw (10, 20), 1 way to draw (20, 20), and 4 ways to draw (20, 10)\nways_20_or_more = 2 + 4 + 1 + 4\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = ways_20_or_more / total_ways\nprobability\n```\n"
