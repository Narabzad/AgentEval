  "solution": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.",

    "This is a combinatorial problem. To solve it, we can think of the problem as two separate problems: \n1) The number of ways the 4 people (not including Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) can sit around the table.\n2) The number of ways Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be inserted into the 4 spaces created by the other 4 people.\n\nThe first part can be calculated using (n-1)! because the seating arrangements are circular, which is (4-1)!.\nThe second part can be calculated using arrangement formula, because Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas cannot sit together, so we treat them as separate individuals trying to sit in the 4 spaces. They can sit in 4P3 ways.\n\nFinally, we multiply the two parts together to get the total number of ways. \n\nSo, let's execute this in Python. We will use the built-in `math` module for the factorial and permutation calculations.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
