First, we apply the fact that for all real numbers $x,$ $\\lfloor x \\rfloor > x - 1.$\n\nTo see this, recall that any real number can be split up into its integer and fractional parts:\n\\[x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}.\\]The fractional part of a real number is always less than 1, so $x < \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1.$  Hence, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor > x - 1.$\n\nThen\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{b + c + d}{a} \\right\\rfloor &> \\frac{b + c + d}{a} - 1, \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{a + c + d}{b} \\right\\rfloor &> \\frac{a + c + d}{b} - 1, \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{a + b + d}{c} \\right\\rfloor &> \\frac{a + b + d}{c} - 1, \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{a + b + c}{d} \\right\\rfloor &> \\frac{a + b + c}{d} - 1.\n\\end{align*}Adding these inequalities, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nS &> \\frac{b + c + d}{a} - 1 + \\frac{a + c + d}{b} - 1 + \\frac{a + b + d}{c} - 1 + \\frac{a + b + c}{d} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{a} + \\frac{a}{c} + \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{d} + \\frac{d}{a} + \\frac{b}{c} + \\frac{c}{b} + \\frac{b}{d} + \\frac{d}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{d}{c} - 4.\n\\end{align*}By AM-GM, $\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{a} \\ge 2.$  The same applies to the other pairs of fractions, so $S > 6 \\cdot 2 - 4 = 8.$  As a sum of floors, $S$ itself must be an integer, so $S$ must be at least 9.\n\nWhen $a = 4$ and $b = c = d = 5,$ $S = 9.$  Therefore, the minimum value of $S$ is $\\boxed{9}.$",

    "This problem is a mathematical optimization problem. However, it involves a floor function and division, which makes it a non-trivial problem to solve analytically. Moreover, since the problem is formulated with variables and not specific numbers, it might not be possible to solve it by brute-force calculation. Instead, it requires mathematical reasoning and insight.\n\nHowever, given the nature of the floor function and the division operation, we can form some intuitive hypotheses. The floor function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to a given number. This means that for a fixed numerator, the floor function value decreases as the denominator increases. Conversely, for a fixed denominator, the floor function value increases as the numerator increases. This suggests that the minimum value of the expression may be achieved when the variables a, b, c, and d are equal, which would make each term of the expression as small as possible.\n\nTo confirm this, we could calculate the expression for the case where a = b = c = d = 1. \n\nHowever, this solution assumes that all variables are positive and real, meaning they can take any value greater than zero and not just integers. Hence, it might not be the definitive minimum.\n\nNonetheless, it is a starting point. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\n# define the function\ndef expression(a, b, c, d):\n    return (b + c + d)//a + (a + c + d)//b + (a + b + d)//c + (a + b + c)//d\n\n# calculate the expression for a = b = c = d = 1\nexpression(1, 1, 1, 1)\n```\n"
