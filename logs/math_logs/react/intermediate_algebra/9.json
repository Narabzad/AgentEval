    "The given expression is symmetric in x and y. Therefore, we can assume that x=y=0.5 without loss of generality. This is because if x and y are switched, the value of the expression remains the same. So, let's substitute x=y=0.5 in the expression and calculate its value. This will give us the maximum value. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nx = y = 0.5\nexpression_value = x**4 * y + x * y**4\nexpression_value\n```\n"
