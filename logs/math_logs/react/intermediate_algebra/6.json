    "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the equations $x+y=2$ and $x^5+y^5=82$. Since $x+y=2$, we can square this equation to get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4$. However, we are interested in $x^2 + y^2$, so we can subtract $2xy$ from both sides to get $x^2 + y^2 = 4 - 2xy$.\n\nThen, we can substitute $y = 2 - x$ into the second equation $x^5+(2-x)^5=82$ and solve for $x$. After that, we can calculate $x^2 + y^2$ for each solution and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nLet's perform these steps in python. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\ny = 2 - x\n\nequation = x**5 + y**5 - 82\nsolutions = solve(equation, x)\n\nsum_squares = sum([(sol**2 + (2-sol)**2) for sol in solutions])\nsum_squares\n```\nTypeError(\"'int' object is not callable\")",
