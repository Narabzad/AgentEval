    "First, I need to understand the problem statement. \n\nThe point F is fixed at (5,0). Q is the projection of P on the line x = 16/5. So, Q will always have its x-coordinate as 16/5, and it will have the same y-coordinate as P.\n\nThe ratio of the distances PF/PQ is always 5/4. This means that the distance from P to F is always 5/4 times the distance from P to Q.\n\nThe distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a plane is given by the formula sqrt((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2). \n\nSo, I need to set up an equation based on the above information and solve it. \n\nLet's denote the coordinates of P as (x, y). Then the coordinates of Q are (16/5, y).\n\nThe equation becomes: sqrt((x - 5)\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 5/4 * sqrt((x - 16/5)\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Squaring both sides to get rid of the square roots gives: (x - 5)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25/16 * ((x - 16/5)\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nFrom here, I can simplify the equation to find the equation of the curve.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
