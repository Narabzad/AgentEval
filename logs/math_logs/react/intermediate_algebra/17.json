    "To find the minimum value of the function, I can use numerical methods such as gradient descent or brute force search using Python. However, because the function involves square roots of quadratic functions, it may not be smooth or differentiable everywhere, which can cause issues for gradient-based methods. Therefore, I will use a brute force method: I will compute the function values at many points in a certain interval and find the minimum value. I will use the numpy and scipy libraries to do this. The interval of x can be chosen based on the domain of the function, which is determined by the conditions that the arguments of the square root functions must be nonnegative. I will first find the domain of the function.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the function\ndef f(x):\n    return np.sqrt(-x**2 + 4*x + 21) - np.sqrt(-x**2 + 3*x + 10)\n\n# Find the domain of the function\nx_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)\ny_values = f(x_values)\n\nplt.plot(x_values, y_values)\nplt.title('Plot of the function')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('f(x)')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n",
    "The plot shows that the function is defined for x in the range approximately from -1 to 5. The function seems to be smooth within this interval, so it should be fine to use a numerical method to find the minimum. Now I can use the minimize function from scipy.optimize to find the minimum value of the function within this interval.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\n# Find the minimum of the function within the domain\nresult = minimize(f, x0=0, bounds=[(-1, 5)])\nresult.fun\n```\n"
