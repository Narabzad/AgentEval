    "To find the largest possible value of $\\frac{x+y}{x-y}$, we need to maximize the value of $x+y$ and minimize the value of $x-y$. To do this, we should choose the maximum value of $x$ and $y$ that are within the given range and the minimum value of $x$ and $y$ that are within the given range, respectively. \n\nLet's write this out in Python to verify. We'll use the max() and min() functions to find the maximum and minimum values of $x$ and $y$, respectively. We'll then compute $\\frac{x+y}{x-y}$ using these values. \n\nWe should be careful around the denominator, as it could become zero and lead to a division by zero error. We'll need to check if $x$ is equal to $y$ before doing the division. If $x$ is equal to $y$, the expression $\\frac{x+y}{x-y}$ is undefined, and we'll return an appropriate message. \n\nLet's proceed with this calculation.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
