    "To solve this problem, I need to use the Python sympy library, which allows me to do symbolic computations, like finding the minimum of a function. I will first define the symbols a, b, and then the function. After that, I will use the sympy function solve() to solve the equation ab=8, and subs() to substitute b=8/a in the function. Then I will differentiate the function and set it equal to zero to find the minimum. Finally, I will substitute a=b=sqrt(8) into the function to find the minimum value.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
