(This technique is often referred to as the Ravi Substitution.)  Note that\n\\begin{align*}\na &= y + z, \\\\\nb &= x + z, \\\\\nc &= x + y.\n\\end{align*}If $s$ is even, then $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all positive integers.  So, we can set $x = i,$ $y = j,$ and $z = k,$ which gives us the parameterization $(a,b,c) = (j + k, i + k, i + j).$\n\nIf $s$ is odd, then $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all of the form $n - \\frac{1}{2},$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  So, we can set $x = i - \\frac{1}{2},$ $y = j - \\frac{1}{2},$ and $z = k - \\frac{1}{2}.$  This gives us the parameterization $(a,b,c) = (j + k - 1, i + k - 1, i + j - 1).$\n\nThus, our sum is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{(a,b,c) \\in T} \\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} &= \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} + \\frac{2^{j + k - 1}}{3^{i + k - 1} 5^{i + j - 1}} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} + \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{17}{2} \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{17}{2} \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{15^i} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^j \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^k \\\\\n&= \\frac{17}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1/15}{1 - 1/15} \\cdot \\frac{2/5}{1 - 2/5} \\cdot \\frac{2/3}{1 - 2/3} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{17}{21}}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "This is a combinatorics problem related to triangle inequalities. According to triangle inequality, the sum of lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the remaining side. So, we need to find all possible combinations of a, b, c that satisfy these conditions. Then, we can calculate the sum of 2^a / 3^b * 5^c for these combinations. We can solve this problem by brute force, considering all possible values of a, b, c up to some reasonable limit, and then checking if they satisfy the triangle inequality. In terms of programming, we can use nested loops to iterate over a, b, c and a conditional statement to check the triangle inequality.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\na_max = 10\nb_max = 10\nc_max = 10\n\nresult = 0\nfor a in range(1, a_max + 1):\n    for b in range(1, b_max + 1):\n        for c in range(1, c_max + 1):\n            if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:\n                result += 2**a / 3**b * 5**c\n\nprint(result)\n```\n7063279996.150653\n"
