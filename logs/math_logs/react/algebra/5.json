  "problem": "If $\\frac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1}=m$, and $x$ can be any real number except $1$, what real values can $m$ NOT have?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Algebra",
  "solution": "We notice that the numerator of the fraction factors into $(3x-1)(x-1)$. Substituting this into the given expression, we get $m=\\dfrac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1} = \\dfrac{(3x-1)(x-1)}{x-1}$. This simplifies to $m=3x-1$ if $x$ is not 1. Thus, $m$ can be any real number except for the value it takes when $x$ is $1.$ This value is $3(1)-1=3-1=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "This is a limit problem. The values that m cannot have are those for which the limit as x approaches 1 does not exist. The question can be rephrased as: what are the limits as x approaches 1 from the left and from the right for the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 4x + 1) / (x - 1)? If these two limits are not equal, then there is a discontinuity at x=1, and the value that m cannot take on is the limit that does not exist.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nf = (3*x**2 - 4*x + 1) / (x - 1)\n\nlimit_left = sp.limit(f, x, 1, dir='-')\nlimit_right = sp.limit(f, x, 1, dir='+')\n\nprint(limit_left, limit_right)\n```\n2 2\n"
