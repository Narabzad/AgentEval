    "The two functions f(x) and g(x) intersect where they are equal to each other. Therefore, I need to solve the equation f(x) = g(x). Looking at the functions, I can see that they are identical except for the polynomial part at the end. This means that to find the point of intersection, I need to solve the equation 72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1 = 72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13. However, this equation is a polynomial equation of degree 4, which is not straightforward to solve analytically. Therefore, I will use numerical methods to solve it, specifically the scipy.optimize.fsolve function in Python, which finds the roots of a function. I will define the difference between the two polynomials as a Python function and use fsolve to find its root. This will give me the x-value where the two functions intersect. Note that fsolve might not find the largest root if there are multiple roots, but it will find one of them. To find the largest root, I could use the scipy.optimize.fminbound function to find the maximum of the function in a given range. However, without knowing more about the function, I don't know what range to use. Therefore, I will use fsolve and hope that it finds the largest root. If it doesn't, the only other option would be to try different ranges with fminbound until the largest root is found. Since this is not feasible, I will proceed with fsolve.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
