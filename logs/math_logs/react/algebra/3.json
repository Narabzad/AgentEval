  "solution": "Setting the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other, it follows that $2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$. Re-arranging, $2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0$. For there to be exactly one solution for $x$, then the discriminant of the given quadratic must be equal to zero. Thus, $(k+1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = (k+1)^2 - 16 = 0$, so $k+1 = \\pm 4$. Taking the negative value, $k = \\boxed{-5}$.",

    "To solve this problem, I will need to find the value of $k$ such that the quadratic $2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$ has exactly one solution. This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic is equal to zero. The discriminant of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$. In this equation, $a = 2$, $b = k+1$, and $c = 6-4 = 2$. Therefore, I need to solve the equation $(k+1)^2 - 4*2*2 = 0$ for $k$. I will use the sympy library in Python to solve this equation.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
