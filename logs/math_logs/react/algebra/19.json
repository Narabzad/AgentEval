  "problem": "Fake gold bricks are made by covering concrete cubes with gold paint, so the cost of the paint is proportional to their surface area while the cost of the concrete is proportional to their volume.  If a 1 inch cube costs $\\$1.30$ to make while a 2 inch cube costs $\\$6.80$, then how much would a 3 inch cube cost?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Algebra",
  "solution": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.  Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$.  Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$.",

    "The cost of the brick is the sum of the cost of the concrete (proportional to the volume) and the cost of the paint (proportional to the surface area). The volume of a cube is given by side^3 and the surface area is given by 6*side^2. We can set up two equations based on the information given and solve for the cost per unit volume and per unit surface area. Then we can use those values to calculate the cost of a 3 inch cube. The equations will be:\n1. cost_1 = volume_cost*1^3 + surface_cost*6*1^2\n2. cost_2 = volume_cost*2^3 + surface_cost*6*2^2\nWe can solve these equations to get the values of volume_cost and surface_cost, and then substitute these values into the equation for the cost of a 3 inch cube:\ncost_3 = volume_cost*3^3 + surface_cost*6*3^2\nThis problem is a system of linear equations that can be solved using numpy's linalg.solve function. Let's calculate it. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# costs of 1 inch and 2 inch cubes\ncost_1 = 1.30\ncost_2 = 6.80\n\n# coefficients for volume and surface area in the system of equations\ncoeffs = np.array([[1, 6], [8, 24]])\n\n# constants on the other side of the equations\nconsts = np.array([cost_1, cost_2])\n\n# solve for volume_cost and surface_cost\nvolume_cost, surface_cost = np.linalg.solve(coeffs, consts)\n\n# calculate the cost of a 3 inch cube\ncost_3 = volume_cost*3**3 + surface_cost*6*3**2\ncost_3\n```\n"
