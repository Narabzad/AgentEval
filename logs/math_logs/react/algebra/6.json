    "To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. So we have $x^2 + a = ax$. We can rearrange this to $x^2 - ax + a = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots: $x = [a \u00b1 sqrt(a^2 - 4a)] / 2$. The discriminant $a^2 - 4a$ must be greater than or equal to 0 for the roots to be real. Therefore, we can set $a^2 - 4a >= 0$ and solve for a.
