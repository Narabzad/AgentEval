Problem 0 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: (-\infty, -14)\cup(-3,\infty)

Reply: $(-3, 14)$
%%%%%%%
Check: 1. the answer in the reply is: "(-3, 14)"

2. the answer in the reply does not match the ground truth answer. the ground truth answer is "(-\infty, -14)\cup(-3,\infty)", while the answer in the reply is "(-3, 14)".

3. therefore, "the answer is incorrect. correct answer: (-\infty, -14)\cup(-3,\infty) | answer extracted: (-3, 14)".

Problem 1 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 93

Reply: 161.5
%%%%%%%
Check: 1. extract the answer in the reply: "the answer is 161.5".

2. in this mathematics problem, the answer has to be given in numerical form. the problem is about an arithmetic progression, compounds of different indexed terms, and uses the definition of this progression to sum up certain terms. the given answer is a decimal value rather than an integer which can be suspicious as the common difference in the progression is an integer (1) so the sum of any terms should be an integer as well.

3. "the answer is incorrect. correct answer: 93 | answer extracted: 161.5."

Problem 4 | Is_correct False | Correct Answer: 12, 10, 6

Reply: 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
%%%%%%%
Check: 1. the answer in the reply is: "12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1".

2. the answer in the reply does not match the ground truth answer. the correct value for c should make the equation have real and rational roots. the condition for the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 to be real and rational is b^2 - 4ac >= 0 and a perfect square. in the given problem with a=1, b=-7 and c, the condition will be given as 49 - 4c is a perfect square. here, the values of c producing this condition are only 12,10, and 6 but reply contain other values as well.

3. "the answer is incorrect. correct answer: 12, 10, 6 | answer extracted: 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1".

Problem 12 | Is_correct True | Correct Answer: 7

Reply: 7.0
%%%%%%%
Check: 1. the answer extracted from the reply is "7.0".

2. the ground truth answer is "7". after comparing the extracted answer and the ground truth we can see they both represent the same number. although the answer from the reply is given in a decimal format, the problem doesn't specify a required format. as the problem only asks for the 'y' coordinate of a point, this doesn't limit the form of the answer. therefore the formats are interchangeable in this context.

3. the answer is correct.
