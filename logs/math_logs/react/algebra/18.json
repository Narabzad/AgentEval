    "Firstly, I need to find the intersections of the two equations. The intersections are the points (x, y) that satisfy both equations. I can find these by setting $x^2 = 1 - x$ and solving for x. Once I have x, I can solve for y by substituting x into either of the two equations. \nAfter finding the two points, I can calculate the distance between them using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. \nI will use sympy package to solve the equations and calculate the distance. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt\n\n# define the symbols\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# define the equations\neq1 = Eq(x**2, y)\neq2 = Eq(x + y, 1)\n\n# solve the equations to find the intersections\nintersections = solve((eq1,eq2), (x, y))\n\n# calculate the distance between the intersections\ndistance = sqrt((intersections[1][0] - intersections[0][0])**2 + (intersections[1][1] - intersections[0][1])**2)\ndistance\n```\n",
