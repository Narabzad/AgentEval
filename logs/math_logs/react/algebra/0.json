Both factors are positive for $x>-3$ and both factors are negative for $x<-14$.  When $-14<x<-3$, one factor is positive and the other negative, so their product is negative.   Therefore, the range of $x$ that satisfies the inequality is $ \\boxed{(-\\infty, -14)\\cup(-3,\\infty)} $.",

    "To find the x that satisfy the inequality, I need to solve the inequality. First, I will expand both sides of the inequality and then simplify it to a form that can be solved.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\nx = symbols('x')\nlhs = expand((2*x + 10)*(x + 3))\nrhs = expand((3*x + 9)*(x + 8))\nlhs, rhs\n```\n",
    "The left-hand side expands to `2*x**2 + 16*x + 30` and the right-hand side expands to `3*x**2 + 33*x + 72`. I will subtract the right-hand side from the left-hand side to get a new inequality of the form `0 < f(x)`.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nineq = lhs - rhs\nineq\n```\n",
    "The inequality simplifies to `-x**2 - 17*x - 42 < 0`. I will find the roots of the equation `f(x) = 0` where `f(x) = -x**2 - 17*x - 42`. This will help me to understand the intervals where the inequality is satisfied.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nfrom sympy import solve\n\nroots = solve(ineq, x)\nroots\n```\n",
    "The roots of the equation are `-3` and `14`. Now, I will test the sign of `f(x)` in the intervals `(-inf, -3)`, `(-3, 14)`, and `(14, inf)`. I'll pick a test point from each interval and substitute it into `f(x)`. If `f(x) < 0` then the interval is part of the solution.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\ntest_points = [-4, 0, 15]\nsigns = [ineq.subs(x, tp) < 0 for tp in test_points]\nsigns\n```\n"
