  "solution": "Let $S = a_1 + a_3 + \\dots + a_{97}$ and $T = a_2 + a_4 + \\dots + a_{98}$. Then the given equation states that $S + T = 137$, and we want to find $T$.\n\nWe can build another equation relating $S$ and $T$: note that \\[\\begin{aligned} T-S &= (a_2-a_1) + (a_4-a_3) + \\dots + (a_{98}-a_{97}) \\\\ &= \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\dots + 1}_{49 \\text{ times }} \\\\ &= 49 \\end{aligned}\\]since $(a_n)$ has common difference $1$. Then, adding the two equations $S+T=137$ and $T-S=49$, we get $2T=137+49=186$, so $T = \\tfrac{186}{2} = \\boxed{93}$.",

    "The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: n/2 * (a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. Since we know that the sum of the first 98 terms is 137, we can calculate the first term of the series using this formula. Once we have the first term, we can easily calculate the second, fourth, sixth, etc. terms by adding 1 to the previous term. The sum of these terms can then be calculated by adding them up. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input:\n",
