    "This is a quadratic equation, and the solution for a quadratic equation is given by the formula x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 5, c = 8.\nFirst, I will calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac). If the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex and of the form a \u00b1 bi. In that case, I will use the formula to calculate the roots. The real part of the root is -b/2a (which is 'a' in the form a \u00b1 bi) and the imaginary part is sqrt(-D)/2a (which is 'b' in the form a \u00b1 bi). I will then calculate a + b^2.

    "The output is an error stating that `result` is not defined. This suggests that the condition `D < 0` is not true, so the code inside the `if` block is not being executed. This means the discriminant is not less than 0, which means the roots of the equation are real, not complex. This is unexpected because the question asks for the roots in the form a + bi, which suggests they should be complex.\n\nI realise I have made a mistake in my initial thought process. The coefficients of the quadratic equation are a = 1, b = 5, c = 8. Therefore, the quadratic equation should be x^2 + 5x + 8 = 0, not x^2 - 5x + 8 = 0. This means that the discriminant would be (5)^2 - 4*1*8 = 25 - 32 = -7, which is less than 0. So, the roots should be complex as expected.\n\nI will correct my code accordingly.
