  "problem": "Amaretta's birthday is July 27, and her brother Enzo's birthday is September 3. Every year, Amaretta and Enzo celebrate by eating cake every day from Amaretta's birthday through Enzo's birthday (including both birthdays). If they did this for the first time in 2008, how many cake-eating days will they have observed by the end of 2016?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "There are $39$ cake-eating days each year: the last $5$ days of July, all $31$ days of August, and the first $3$ days of September.\n\nThere are $9$ years in the list $$2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016.$$ Besides listing them out, we can also see this by subtracting $2007$ from each year, which gives us the list $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ (which clearly has $9$ entries).\n\n$39$ cake-eating days each year for $9$ years make $39\\cdot 9 = \\boxed{351}$ days in total.",

    "To solve this problem, I need to calculate the number of days between Amaretta's birthday and Enzo's birthday, inclusive. Then, I will multiply this by the number of years from 2008 to 2016. It's important to note that if either of their birthdays fall on a leap year, the number of days will be different. As such, I'll need to account for leap years in my calculation. I will use the datetime module in Python to achieve this. Specifically, I will create datetime objects for the two birthdays, calculate the difference in days, and then multiply this by the number of years. I will also add an extra day for each leap year in the range from 2008 to 2016.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
