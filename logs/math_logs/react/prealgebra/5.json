  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "We consider it by four cases:\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: There are $3$ perfect squares that only have $1$ digit, $1^{2},$ $2^{2},$ and $3^{2}.$\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: The smallest perfect square that has $2$ digits is $4^{2},$ and the largest is $9^{2},$ so that's a total of $6$ perfect squares with $2$ digits.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: The smallest perfect square with $3$ digits is $10^{2},$ and the largest is $31^{2},$ yielding a total of $22.$\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 4: The smallest perfect square with $4$ digits is $32^{2},$ and the last one that is no greater than $2500$ is $50^{2},$ giving a total of $19.$\n\nSo we have a total of $1\\times3+2\\times6+3\\times22+4\\times19=\\boxed{157}$ digits.",

    "To solve this problem, I need to find all perfect squares between 1 and 2500, then convert each number to a string and concatenate them to form a sequence. Then I will count the number of characters in the sequence. The count will represent the number of digits in the sequence.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nsequence = \"\"\n\nfor i in range(1, 51):  # we only need to go up to 50, because 50*50 = 2500\n    square = i * i\n    sequence += str(square)\n\nlen(sequence)\n```\n"
