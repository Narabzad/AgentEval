  "problem": "Bekah has exactly three brass house number digits: 2, 3 and 5. How many distinct numbers can she form using one or more of the digits?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "If Bekah uses only one digit, she can form three numbers. If she uses two digits, she has three choices for the tens place and two for the units, so she can form six numbers. Finally, if Bekah uses all three digits, she has three choices for the hundreds place, two for the tens, and one for the units, so she can form six numbers. Thus, Bekah can form $3 + 6 + 6 = \\boxed{15}$ distinct numbers.",

    "In this problem, we're asked to find out how many distinct numbers can be formed using one or more of the digits 2, 3, and 5. We can do this by finding all the possible combinations of these digits, which include numbers formed by using just one digit, two digits, and all three digits.\n\nTo do this, we can use the Python `itertools` module, which provides a function `combinations` that returns all possible combinations of a list of elements, given a specific combination length. We can use this function with combination lengths of 1, 2, and 3, and then count all the unique combinations we get.\n\nFinally, we need to remember that for each combination of length greater than 1, we can form multiple distinct numbers by permuting the digits. So, we will also use the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module to get all possible permutations for each combination.\n\nWith all this in mind, I'll go ahead and write the Python code to solve this problem.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
    "I am going to use the itertools module to solve this problem. I will use the combinations function to get all combinations of the digits 2, 3, and 5 of lengths 1, 2, and 3. Then, I will use the permutations function on each combination to get all possible distinct numbers that can be formed. I will add all these numbers to a set to remove any duplicates and then count the number of unique numbers in the set. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndigits = [2, 3, 5]\nunique_numbers = set()\n\n# Get all combinations of lengths 1, 2, and 3\nfor r in range(1, 4):\n    combinations = itertools.combinations(digits, r)\n    for combination in combinations:\n        # Get all permutations of each combination\n        permutations = itertools.permutations(combination)\n        for permutation in permutations:\n            # Convert each permutation to a number and add it to the set\n            unique_numbers.add(int(''.join(map(str, permutation))))\n\nlen(unique_numbers)\n```\n"
