Since $\\angle ADB = 90^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle DAB = 45^\\circ$, so $\\triangle ABD$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle.  Similarly, $\\triangle ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $DA=DB = DC = 5$, so $BC = BD+DC = 10$, and  \\[[ABC] = \\frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \\frac{(5)({10})}{2} = \\boxed{25}.\\]",
