  "problem": "Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1. How many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime with 28?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot 7$, a positive integer is relatively prime with $28$ if and only if it contains neither $2$ nor $7$ in its prime factorization. In other words, we want to count the number of integers between $11$ and $29$ inclusive which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $7$.\n\nAll of the odd numbers are not divisible by 2; there are 10 such numbers.  The only one of these that is divisible by 7 is 21, so there are $10- 1 =\\boxed{9}$ numbers between 10 and 30 that are relatively prime with 28.",

    "To solve this, I will create a helper function to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. Then I will iterate through the numbers greater than 10 and less than 30, using the gcd function to check if each number is relatively prime with 28. I will count the numbers that are relatively prime and return that count. \nLet's proceed with this plan. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(11, 30):\n    if gcd(i, 28) == 1:\n        count += 1\n\ncount\n```\n"
