    "The question is asking for the length of the line segment DF. Since we know the lengths of DE and EF and that they form a right angle at E, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of DF. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. We can write this as a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c represents the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, DE and EF are the two sides of the right triangle and DF is the hypotenuse. Therefore, we can calculate the length of DF as the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of DE and EF.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# lengths of DE and EF\nDE = 4\nEF = 4\n\n# calculate the length of DF using the Pythagorean theorem\nDF = math.sqrt(DE**2 + EF**2)\nDF\n```\n"
