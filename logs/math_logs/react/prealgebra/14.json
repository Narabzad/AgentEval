  "problem": "Each interior angle of a polygon measures 170 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is $180(n-2)$, where $n$ is the number of sides. That means each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees. We set this equal to 170 degrees and solve for $n$. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}&=170\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 180n-360&=170n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 10n&=360\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=36.\n\\end{align*} The polygon has $\\boxed{36}$ sides.",

    "To solve this problem, I will use the formula for the interior angles of a polygon: (n-2) * 180 = sum of interior angles, where n is the number of sides in the polygon. I can isolate n to find the number of sides: n = sum of interior angles / 180 + 2. The sum of the interior angles is the given angle (170 degrees) multiplied by the number of sides, so I can substitute this into the equation to find n.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
    "I need to first define the formula for the sum of the interior angles in a polygon: (n-2) * 180 where n is the number of sides. Since each interior angle in this case is 170 degrees, I can set up the equation as n * 170 = (n-2) * 180 and solve for n. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: import sympy as sp\n\nn = sp.symbols('n')\nequation = sp.Eq(n * 170, (n - 2) * 180)\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, n)\nsolution\n",
