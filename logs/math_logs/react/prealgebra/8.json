If a two-letter sequence of letters (such as CO or EE) is chosen at random, what is the probability that it is a postal abbreviation for one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

  "solution": "There are $26\\cdot 26$ possible two-letter sequences of letters, since we have 26 choices for the first and then 26 choices for the second.  But only 52 of these possibilities are valid, so our answer is $\\frac{52}{26\\cdot 26} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1}{13}}$.",

    "First, let's calculate the total number of possible two-letter combinations. Since each letter can be any of the 26 letters in the alphabet, and the second can also be any of the 26 letters, the total number of combinations is 26^2. Then, we know that there are 50 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, so 52 valid combinations. The probability of a randomly chosen two-letter combination being a valid postal abbreviation is then 52 out of 26^2. I can calculate this in Python. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: total_combinations = 26**2\nvalid_combinations = 52\nprobability = valid_combinations / total_combinations\nprobability\n",
