  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Prealgebra",
  "solution": "Both fractions have the same denominator, so we can subtract them: \\[\\frac{2m+8}{3}-\\frac{2-m}{3}=\\frac{(2m+8)-(2-m)}{3}\\] Distributing the negative sign across the parentheses, we get \\[\\frac{2m+8-2-(-m)}{3}=\\frac{2m+8-2+m}{3}=\\frac{3m+6}{3}\\] Notice that every number in the numerator has a common factor of 3. We can use the distributive law in reverse to get \\[\\frac{3m+6}{3}=\\frac{3(m+2)}{3}=\\frac{\\cancel{3}(m+2)}{\\cancel{3}}=\\boxed{m+2}.\\]",
