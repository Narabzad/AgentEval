  "solution": "It is almost always easier to use fractions than decimals when dividing. So the first task is to convert these repeating decimals to fractions. First, $.0\\overline{3}$: \\[\n10 \\cdot .0\\overline{3} = .\\overline{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow .0\\overline{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\div 10 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{30}.\n\\]Next, $.\\overline{03}$: \\[\n99 \\cdot .\\overline{03} = (100-1) \\cdot .\\overline{03} = 3.\\overline{03} - .\\overline{03} = 3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow .\\overline{03} = \\frac{3}{99} = \\frac{3}{3 \\cdot 33} = \\frac{1}{33}.\n\\]We now have the tools to make our calculation: \\begin{align*}\n.0\\overline{3} \\div .\\overline{03} &= \\frac{1}{30} \\div \\frac{1}{33}= \\frac{1}{30} \\cdot \\frac{33}{1}\\\\\n&= \\frac{33}{30} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 11}{3 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{11}{10}\\\\\n&= \\frac{10+1}{10} = \\boxed{1\\frac{1}{10}}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "This question is asking for a division operation between two recurring decimal numbers. Once I perform the division, I will need to format the result as a mixed number. To do this, I'll use the Python language's features for arithmetic operations and string formatting.\n\nI can convert repeating decimal numbers into fractions as follows:\n0.0(3) = 3/90\n0.(03) = 3/99\nThen I'll perform the division operation and turn the result into a mixed number. \n\nIn Python, I can use the fractions module to perform operations on fractions and also to convert a decimal to a mixed number.
