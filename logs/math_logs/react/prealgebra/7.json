    "First, I need to understand the problem. The problem is a geometry problem involving two triangles: an equilateral triangle and a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle. The hypotenuse of the right triangle is one side of the equilateral triangle. The short leg of the right triangle is given. I need to find the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common. \n\nThis is a geometry problem and it can be solved using the properties of $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangles and equilateral triangles. A $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle is a special kind of right triangle where the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2. In this case, the shorter leg of the right triangle (opposite to the 30 degree angle) is given as 6 units. Therefore, the longer leg of the right triangle (opposite to the 60 degree angle) will be 6\u221a3 units. This is also the height of the equilateral triangle. \n\nThe side of the equilateral triangle (which is also the hypotenuse of the right triangle) will be 2*6 = 12 units. \n\nNow, the distance between the two vertices of the triangles that are not in common is the difference in the heights of the equilateral triangle and the right triangle, which is the height of the equilateral triangle minus the longer leg of the right triangle.\n\nThe height of an equilateral triangle with side length 'a' is given by \u221a3/2*a. The height of the equilateral triangle in this case will be \u221a3/2*12. \n\nTherefore, the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common is \u221a3/2*12 - 6\u221a3.\n\nI can calculate this using Python.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
