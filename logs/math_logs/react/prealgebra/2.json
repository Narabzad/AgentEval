    "I need to calculate the expression given in the question. I will use Python's math library for this calculation. I will first calculate the numerator, which is the square root of (2.5^2 - 0.7^2), and then divide it by the denominator, which is (2.7 - 2.5). I will then print the result. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\nnumerator = math.sqrt(2.5**2 - 0.7**2)\ndenominator = 2.7 - 2.5\n\nresult = numerator / denominator\nprint(result)\n```\n11.99999999999999\n"
