  "problem": "There are two cameras that take pictures of a traffic intersection. Camera A starts taking pictures at $6$ AM and takes a picture every $11$ minutes. Camera B starts taking pictures at $7$ AM and takes pictures every $7$ minutes. Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time at four different times before noon. When Camera A and Camera B take their last picture together, how many minutes before noon is it?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "If Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time, they will take a picture $77$ minutes later at the same time. Therefore, if we can find the first time they take a picture together, then we can continue adding $77$ minutes to figure out when the fourth picture was taken. Camera A's first pictures after $7$ AM is at $7:06$, followed by $7:17$ and $7:28$. Camera B will take a picture at $7:28$. From here, we add $77$ minutes until we have taken four pictures. $7:28$ is followed by $8:45$, which is followed by $10:02$, which is followed by $11:19$. This is $\\boxed{41}$ minutes before noon.",

    "I need to find the times when both cameras take a picture. I can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the two intervals (11 minutes and 7 minutes). Then, I need to determine how many times this occurs before noon, starting from the latest common time (7 AM). The fourth occurrence of this will be the last time they take a picture together before noon. I will then subtract this time from noon to find the number of minutes before noon this occurs. \nTo find the LCM, I can use the formula LCM(a, b) = abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b). \nThen, I will use a loop to find the fourth occurrence of this LCM. \nFinally, I will subtract this time from noon (which is 12*60 = 720 minutes after 0:00) to find the required number of minutes. \nI will implement this in Python. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_minutes_before_noon():\n    interval_A = 11\n    interval_B = 7\n    start_time = 7 * 60  # 7:00 AM in minutes\n    noon = 12 * 60  # Noon in minutes\n\n    lcm = abs(interval_A * interval_B) // math.gcd(interval_A, interval_B)  # Least common multiple of intervals\n\n    count = 0\n    time = start_time\n    while time < noon:\n        count += 1\n        if count == 4:  # If it's the fourth occurrence\n            return noon - time  # Find the minutes before noon\n        time += lcm  # Increase the time by the LCM\n\nprint(find_minutes_before_noon())\n```\n69\n"
