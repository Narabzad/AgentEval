  "solution": "Use the Euclidean algorithm on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. \\begin{align*}\nh(x) &= \\gcd(f(x), g(x)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(12x+7, 5x+2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5x+2, (12x+7)-2(5x+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5x+2, 2x + 3) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2x+3, (5x+2)-2(2x+3)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2x+3, x - 4) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(x-4, (2x+3)-2(x-4)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(x-4, 11)\n\\end{align*}From applying the Euclidean algorithm, we have that the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is 11 if and only if $x-4$ is a multiple of 11. For example, note that $f(4) = 55$ and $g(4) = 22$, and the greatest common divisor of 55 and 22 turns out to be 11. If $x-4$ is not a multiple of 11, then the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be one, since 11 is prime and therefore has no other factors. It follows that $h(x)$ can take on two distinct values; 1 and 11. The sum of all possible values of $h(x)$ is therefore $1 + 11 = \\boxed{12}$.",

    "To find $h(x)$, we first need to determine the values of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ for all positive integers $x$. We then find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of these values. Finally, we sum all possible values of $h(x)$. \n\nWe can use Python's `math.gcd()` function, which returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. \n\nHowever, it's not practical to iterate over all positive integers. Notice that the value of $h(x)$ will repeat after certain intervals due to the nature of the gcd function and linear functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Therefore, we only need to iterate up to the least common multiple (lcm) of the coefficients of $x$ in $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which are 12 and 5 respectively.\n\nThe `math.gcd(a, b)` function returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, while to get the least common multiple (lcm), we can use the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)`.\n\nThen we will create a set to store the unique values of $h(x)$ in order to avoid duplications, and finally sum them up.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define f(x) and g(x)\ndef f(x):\n    return 12*x + 7\n\ndef g(x):\n    return 5*x + 2\n\n# Calculate lcm of 12 and 5\nlcm = abs(12*5) // math.gcd(12, 5)\n\n# Initialize a set to store the unique values of h(x)\nh_values = set()\n\n# Iterate over x from 1 to lcm\nfor x in range(1, lcm + 1):\n    h_values.add(math.gcd(f(x), g(x)))\n\n# Sum up all possible values of h(x)\nsum_h_values = sum(h_values)\nsum_h_values\n```\nTypeError(\"'int' object is not callable\")",
