This is possible only if $\\alpha=3$ and $\\beta=3$, but $\\gamma$ can be $0$ or $1$, giving us two choices for $r$: $$r = 2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^0 = 1000 \\text{~~or~~} r=2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^1 = 7000.$$So the sum of all solutions is $1000+7000=\\boxed{8000}$.",

    "This problem is about the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers. The lcm of two integers a and b is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. In this case, we are looking for all positive integers r that make the lcm of r and 700 equal to 7000.\n\nThe lcm of two numbers is calculated as the product of the two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Therefore, to find the possible values of r, we can use this formula:\n\nlcm(r, 700) = r * 700 // gcd(r, 700)\n\nSince we know that lcm(r, 700) = 7000, we can rearrange the formula to get:\n\nr = lcm(r, 700) * gcd(r, 700) // 700 = 7000 * gcd(r, 700) // 700\n\nTherefore, the possible values of r are the divisors of 7000 // 700 = 10 that also satisfy gcd(r, 700) = 1. This means that r must be a number that does not share any common divisors with 700, i.e., it must be coprime with 700.\n\nTo solve the problem, I can write a Python code that calculates all the divisors of 10, checks if they are coprime with 700 (i.e., their gcd with 700 is 1), and sums them up.\n\nI will start by writing a function to calculate the gcd of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. Then, I will write a function to find all the divisors of 10. Finally, I will loop through the divisors, check if they are coprime with 700, and add them to the sum if they are.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
