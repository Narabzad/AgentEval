  "solution": "Recall that $a\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ if and only if $a-3$ is divisible by 7. Subtracting 3 from every element in the list gives  $$\n82 \\qquad 49,\\!476 \\qquad -70 \\qquad 12,\\!000,\\!000 \\qquad -6\n$$By dividing, we can see that 82 and $-6$ are not divisible by 7, whereas $-70$ and $49,\\!476$ are divisible by 7. To see that $12,\\!000,\\!000$ is not divisible by 7, note that its prime factorization is $(12)(10^6)=(2^2\\cdot 3)(2\\cdot 5)^6 = 2^8\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^6$. So, after striking off the numbers which are congruent to 3 (mod 7), the original list becomes $$\n85 \\qquad \\cancel{49,\\!479} \\qquad \\cancel{-67} \\qquad 12,\\!000,\\!003 \\qquad -3\n$$The sum of the remaining integers is $\\boxed{12,\\!000,\\!085}$.",

    "To solve this problem, first I would need to check the remainder of each number when divided by 7. If the remainder is 3, it is congruent to 3 (mod 7). If the remainder is not 3, it is not congruent and I should include it in my sum. I can do this using the modulo operator in python. I can use a list comprehension to filter out the numbers that are not congruent to 3 (mod 7) and then sum the remaining numbers. Let's do this.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
