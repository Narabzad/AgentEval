  "solution": "All factors of $2^5\\cdot 3^6$ that are perfect squares must be in the form $(2^m\\cdot 3^n)^2=2^{2m}\\cdot 3^{2n}$, where $0\\le2m\\le5$ and $0\\le2n\\le6$ for integers $m$ and $n$. Thus, $0\\le m\\le2$ and $0\\le n\\le3$, for a total of $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ factors that are perfect squares.",

    "To find the number of factors of a number that are perfect squares, I can use the formula for the number of square factors of a number which is $(2a+1)(2b+1)...(2n+1)$ where a, b, ..., n are the powers of the prime factors of the number. In this case, the number has been factored into primes for us: $2^5\\cdot3^6$. So, a=5 and b=6.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input:\n",
