  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "Let $2n-5$, $2n-3$, $2n-1$, $2n+1$, $2n+3$, and $2n+5$ be six consecutive positive odd numbers. Their sum is $(2n-5)+(2n-3)+(2n-1)+(2n+1)+(2n+3)+(2n+5)=12n$. Clearly, for any value of $n$, $12$ must divide the sum. By choosing $n=3$ and $n=5$, we can see that $\\boxed{12}$ is the largest whole number that must be a factor.",

    "The sum of six consecutive odd numbers can be represented as (2n-5) + (2n-3) + (2n-1) + (2n+1) + (2n+3) + (2n+5) for some arbitrary value of n. Simplifying this yields 12n, which means that the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is 12.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nn = 1\nsum_of_six_consecutive_odd_numbers = (2*n-5) + (2*n-3) + (2*n-1) + (2*n+1) + (2*n+3) + (2*n+5)\nprint(sum_of_six_consecutive_odd_numbers)\n```\n12\n"
