  "problem": "Emma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?",

  "solution": "Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.\n\nIf the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is\n\\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dotsm (e_n + 1).\\]Note that $e_i \\ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.\n\nIf $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$\n\nOtherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:\n\\[20 = 2 \\cdot 10 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5.\\]Thus, we have the following cases:\n\n(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$\n\n(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\\cdot3.$\n\n(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3^3=432.$\n\n(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=240.$\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\\boxed{240}$ tiles.",

    "The question is asking for the least number of tiles Emma could have if she can form exactly 10 different rectangular figures using all of her tiles. We need to find the least number that has exactly ten factors. Factors come in pairs, so we need to find the least number that has 20 factors. We can write a python program to find the least number with 20 factors.

    "The code is taking too long to execute, perhaps because the number we're looking for is quite large and the current approach is not efficient. We need to optimize it. The number of factors a number has is determined by its prime factorization. A number $n = p1^{a} * p2^{b} * ...$ has (a+1)(b+1)... factors. So, we need to find the smallest number such that (a+1)(b+1)... = 20. Since we want to minimize the number, we want to minimize the exponents in the prime factorization. The smallest way to express 20 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 2*2*5. The smallest primes are 2, 3, and 5. So, the smallest number with 20 factors is $2^{2-1} * 3^{2-1} * 5^{5-1} = 2 * 3 * 5^{4}$. Let's calculate that.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nn = 2**1 * 3**1 * 5**4\nn\n```\n"
