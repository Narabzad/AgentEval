  "solution": "Note that $27$ and $40$ are relatively prime, so $27$ has an inverse $\\pmod{40}$. Conveniently, the inverse of $27\\pmod{40}$ is easily found to be $3$, as we have $27\\cdot 3 = 81\\equiv 1\\pmod{40}$.\n\nTo solve the congruence $27a\\equiv 17\\pmod{40}$, we multiply both sides by $3$ and simplify: \\begin{align*}\n3\\cdot 27a &\\equiv 3\\cdot 17 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 51 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{40}\n\\end{align*}Each operation in this sequence is reversible, so the solution set is exactly the set of integers congruent to $11\\pmod{40}$. The smallest and second-smallest positive solutions are $11$ and $51$. Their sum is $\\boxed{62}$.",

    "This is a relatively simple modular arithmetic problem. To solve it, I'll first find the general solution to the equation, then find the smallest and second smallest positive integer solutions, and finally add them together.\n\nThe general solution to the equation can be found using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which can find solutions to the equation ax + by = gcd(a, b) for integers a, b, x, and y. In this case, the equation is 27a - 40b = 17.\n\nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm starts by performing a series of divisions with remainder, then uses the results to find x and y. I'll write a function to implement this algorithm. Then I'll use this function to find the general solution to the equation, which will be of the form a = 40k + b for some integer k.\n\nThen, to find the smallest positive integer solution, I'll start with k = 0 and increase k until a is positive. The second smallest positive integer solution will be a + 40. The sum of these two solutions will be the answer to the problem.\n\nLet's start by writing the function to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. In this case, we want to solve the equation 27a \u2261 17 (mod 40), which is equivalent to 27a - 40k = 17 for some integer k. We can rearrange this equation to get a = (17 + 40k) / 27. \n\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer a that satisfies this equation, so we'll start with k = 0 and increase k until we find a solution. Then, the second smallest solution will be a + 40, and the sum of these two solutions will be the answer to the problem. \n\nI'll write a Python code to carry out these calculations.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
