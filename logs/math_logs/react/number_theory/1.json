  "problem": "A Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$.",

    "To solve this problem, we should first determine how many whole hours are within 506 minutes. Each hour is 60 minutes, so we can calculate this by integer division of 506 by 60. After that we can subtract the number of whole hours (in minutes) from 506 to find out how many minutes remain in the last incomplete hour. \n\nFor each hour, the population increases by 5 organisms per minute, so the number of Penteria at the end of each hour is the original population plus 5 * 60. \n\nSince all but the initial ones die at the end of every hour, the number of Penteria at the beginning of the last incomplete hour is the same as the number of Penteria at the start. \n\nFor the last incomplete hour, the population increases by 5 organisms per minute. So, the number of Penteria at the end of 506 minutes is the original population plus 5 * the number of minutes in the last incomplete hour. \n\nWe can calculate the original population by rearranging the above equation:\n\noriginal population = 137 - 5 * the number of minutes in the last incomplete hour.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\ntotal_minutes = 506\nminutes_per_hour = 60\n\n# Calculate number of whole hours and remaining minutes\nwhole_hours, remaining_minutes = divmod(total_minutes, minutes_per_hour)\n\n# Calculate original population\noriginal_population = 137 - 5 * remaining_minutes\n\noriginal_population\n```\n"
