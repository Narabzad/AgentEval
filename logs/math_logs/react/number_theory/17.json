The least common multiple is 40, and $x(x + 3) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 3) = 40$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{8}$.",

    "The question is related to number theory. We know that for every two positive integers `a` and `b`, their product equals the product of their greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm). In mathematical terms, this is `a * b = gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b)`. \n\nIn this case, we know that one of the integers is 40, the gcd is $(x+3)$, and the lcm is $x(x+3)$. So, we can form the equation `40 * b = (x+3) * x(x+3)`. We also know that `b` must be a multiple of $(x+3)$, because $(x+3)$ is the gcd of `40` and `b`. \n\nSo, the strategy is to substitute `x` starting from `1` into the equation and find the smallest `b` that makes the equation hold. We are interested in the smallest `b` because the question asks for the smallest possible value of the other integer. \n\nIn terms of coding, we can solve this problem by using a while loop in Python. We start with `x = 1` and increase `x` by `1` in each iteration. We calculate `b` in each iteration using the formula `b = (x+3) * x(x+3) / 40`. We check if `b` is an integer and if it is a multiple of `x+3`. If both conditions are true, we break the loop and return `b`.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nx = 1\nwhile True:\n    b = (x+3) * x*(x+3) / 40\n    if b.is_integer() and b % (x+3) == 0:\n        break\n    x += 1\nb\n```\n",
