  "problem": "How many perfect square factors does the number 46,656 have?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "$46656=2^6\\cdot3^6$. So, $x$ is a factor of $46656$ if and only if there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $0\\le a\\le6$, $0\\le b\\le6$, and $x=2^a3^b$. Such an $x$ is a perfect square if and only if $a$ and $b$ are both even, which is true if and only if $a$ and $b$ are each 0, 2, 4, or 6. There are $4$ possible values of $a$, and $4$ possible values of $b$, so there are $4\\cdot4=\\boxed{16}$ possible values of $x$.",

    "To find the perfect square factors of a number, we can iterate from 1 to the square root of the number. For each number in the range, we check if the number is a factor of the original number and if the square of the number is also a factor. If both conditions are met, we increment a counter. We'll use this approach to solve the problem.\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_perfect_square_factors(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, math.isqrt(n)+1):\n        if n % i == 0 and n % (i*i) == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ncount_perfect_square_factors(46656)\n```\n"
