    "The set of points described in the question forms a half-sphere with a radius of 5 units (since $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\le 25$) and centered at the origin. The largest cube that can be contained in this half-sphere would have its vertices touching the sphere. So, the side length of the cube would be the diameter of the sphere divided by the square root of 2. The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so the side length of the cube is $2 * radius / sqrt(2)$. We can calculate this using Python. \nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\nradius = 5\nside_length = (2 * radius) / math.sqrt(2)\nside_length\n```\n"
