    "This question involves mathematical operations and trigonometric functions. It seems to be a problem from trigonometry. Python has a built-in math library that can handle trigonometric functions. However, we do not have any specific values of A, B, and C, which are the angles of a triangle in the question. \n\nWithout any specific values of A, B, and C, or any additional conditions or relationships among A, B, and C, it's impossible to calculate a numerical answer for this problem. We can't just input the formulas into Python and expect a numerical result. The question might be incomplete or there might be some theoretical approach to this problem which doesn't involve direct computation.\n\nTherefore, I must say \"I don't know\" as the answer.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:"
