    "This problem involves the trigonometric identities of tangent, sine and cosine. The equation simplifies to tan(19x) = tan(45+96) when using the trigonometric addition formula. This further simplifies to tan(19x) = tan(141). As tangent has a period of 180 degrees, this simplifies to 19x = 141 + k*180, where k is an integer. Solving this for x gives x = (141 + k*180)/19. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer solution, so I need to find the smallest k such that x is positive and an integer. I can do this by iterating over values of k and checking if x is an integer, starting from k = 0.\nInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:",
