    "This question involves finding a solution to a trigonometric equation, which can be solved analytically using Python's math library. The math library includes functions for trigonometric calculations like tangent (tan), cosine (cos), and sine (sin), as well as a function to convert between degrees and radians, which is the unit of measurement used by Python's trigonometric functions. \n\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n\nx = atan((cos(50)/(1 - sin(50)))) + 160\n\nThe atan function returns a result in the range -pi/2 to pi/2, and the result needs to be in degrees. So the solution needs to be converted to degrees by multiplying by 180/pi. Furthermore, if the result is negative, we need to add 360 to get the smallest positive solution.\n\nIn this case, we need to import the math library and use the math.atan, math.cos, math.sin, and math.degrees functions to calculate the value of x. We also need to use a conditional statement to ensure the result is a positive integer. Let's calculate it.\n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# calculate the value of x\nx = math.atan(math.cos(math.radians(50))/(1 - math.sin(math.radians(50))))\nx = math.degrees(x) + 160\n\n# ensure the result is a positive integer\nif x < 0:\n    x += 360\n\nx\n```\n",
    "I see that there is no output provided. It seems that there might have been an error during the execution of the code. Let's attempt to debug the issue. I'll add print statements to the code to better understand where the problem is occurring. \n\nAction: Python_REPL\nAction Input: \n```python\nimport math\n\n# calculate the value of x\nx = math.atan(math.cos(math.radians(50))/(1 - math.sin(math.radians(50))))\nprint(\"After atan:\", x)\nx = math.degrees(x) + 160\nprint(\"After converting to degrees and adding 160:\", x)\n\n# ensure the result is a positive integer\nif x < 0:\n    x += 360\nprint(\"Final x:\", x)\n\nx\n```\nAfter atan: 1.2217304763960306\nAfter converting to degrees and adding 160: 230.0\nFinal x: 230.0\n"
