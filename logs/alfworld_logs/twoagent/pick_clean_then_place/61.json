At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you should choose from two actions: \\\"THOUGHT\\\" or \\\"ACTION\\\". If you choose \\\"THOUGHT\\\", you should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\\\"THOUGHT: your thoughts.\\n\\\" \\\"ACTION: your next action\\n\\\"; If you choose \\\"ACTION\\\", you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\\\"ACTION: your next action\\n\\\". After each of your turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you should plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \\\"Nothing happened\\\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\\n Reminder: \\n1. the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal.\\n2. Take the target household immediatly after you find it.\\n3. Reply 'TERMINATE' only under two circumstances: a). The task has given you clear instructions to return 'TERMINATE' b). The task seems insolvable.\\n Here are two examples.\nYou are in the middle of a room.
